1.Expand Sentiment Analysis Tools: consider integrating other sentiment analysis models or tools for a more robust understanding. Tools like VADER or TextBlob, which are good for short texts (like headlines), might complement FinBERT's capabilities.
2.Expand Data Sources: Include more varied sources of news and data feeds. Integrating social media sentiment analysis, like from Twitter or Reddit, can provide a more comprehensive sentiment analysis.
3.Data Quality Checks: Implement checks to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data collected from different sources. This can include anomaly detection or validation against known benchmarks.
4. Parallel Processing: Use Pythonâ€™s concurrent.futures or similar libraries to make API calls in parallel where possible, reducing the overall data fetching time.
5. Notification System: Develop a system to alert users based on certain sentiment thresholds or changes, which could be critical for trading strategies.
