2024-04-17 23:26:32,meet the district 3 candidates: ‘tell us about your campaign finance’," Between now and the November election, Mission Local is asking each District 3 candidate one question per week, and candidates will get 100 words to respond. We will compile all responses to the 40-odd questions on a “Meet the candidates” page, so that voters can get a full picture of their stances. 
Because Supervisor Aaron Peskin terms out next January, six candidates have filed to run for the seat to lead District 3, which includes North Beach, Chinatown, Union Square, the Financial District, Russian Hill and Nob Hill.  
Question this week: Tell us about your campaign finance — where did you raise the money and how have you been spending it? 
Deputy City Attorney, San Francisco City Attorney’s Office 
My campaign has received generous contributions from Teamsters 350 and individual contributors. This grassroots support comes from individuals who resonate with my vision for the future of District 3 and want to help my team spread that vision to fellow San Franciscans. My campaign’s priority is to facilitate meaningful connections with District 3 residents and create opportunities for me to listen to their ideas for our community’s future while also creating platforms for me to articulate my priorities as their potential next Supervisor. 
Endorsed by: UFCW 648, Teamsters Joint Council 7, Retired Assistant Police Chief Garrett Tom, Board President Aaron Peskin … More. 
Economic recovery leader at the World Economic Forum, former board member at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency 
We are proud to run a grassroots campaign focused on people and will not accept donations from corporate PACs. Over 20% of the funds raised are from every corner of District 3, over 70% of donors are San Franciscans, and we are applying for public finance. We are careful stewards of donations and are powered by volunteers. We have only spent approximately 15% of the funds raised, primarily on bilingual campaign literature and accounting fees. We will be using these funds to power a grassroots campaign focusing resources on bilingual field operations. 
Endorsed by: Community Tenants Association, Teamsters Joint Council 7, 7 of the current Board of Supervisors … More. 
Tech startup founder 
We host small community gatherings, 30-40 people, where we cook authentic Paella together. This Valencian staple is celebrated for how each ingredient supports the others to create a delicious, cohesive dish and for its ability to unite people—a perfect metaphor for our campaign. Here, we discuss issues important to our neighbors and district. All are welcome to come by obtaining tickets at Navarro.vote; once a quorum is reached, we provide dates, usually on a weekend, to celebrate the paella. The response has been great; it has aided in recruiting volunteers, raising funds, and fostering community as a grassroots campaign. 
Self-described formerly homeless, leatherman, boxer 
Ortega declined to respond. 
Executive Director, Neighborhood Centers Together 
I am proud that we were the first candidate to qualify for public financing, a testament to our diverse coalition of everyday supporters. We have received donations from more than 500 individuals, 85% of whom are San Francisco residents. 
Based on the latest filing data, our campaign has: 
We will put these funds to work to go out and talk to District 3 voters and share our message of safer neighborhoods, economic recovery, and more housing. 
Endorsed by: Senator Scott Wiener, State Treasurer Fiona Ma, Supervisor Matt Dorsey, Sheriff Paul Miyamoto … More. 
Former lead with Divvy Homes 
Our funds have come from a wide array of supporters, united by their belief in our vision for San Francisco. 
Professional colleagues, from my decade in the private sector, family and friends who trust my deep love for the city will guide us to better days, and new friends and neighbors made at house parties and during neighborhood canvassing, have generously supported our campaign.

2024-04-17 08:43:15,singapore pledges s$35 million in sustainable finance skills development – fintech singapore,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), in collaboration with the Institute
of Banking and Finance (IBF) and Workforce Singapore (WSG), has launched the
Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map (JTM).

This initiative outlines the necessary skills updates for the local financial
services sector due to increasing sustainability trends.

MAS has identified 20 unique job roles as high priority for upskilling. Key
roles include relationship managers in corporate banking, who will require
knowledge of sectoral decarbonization pathways and sustainable finance
instruments to better identify and explain relevant services to clients.

Portfolio managers will need advanced skills in sustainable investment
management and the capability to construct investment portfolios that align with
investors’ sustainability strategies and preferences.

Additionally, the sector will see the emergence of new job roles in areas such
as Sustainability Risk and Sustainability Strategy, reflecting the increasing
emphasis on sustainability in business strategies.

These roles will demand specialised knowledge, such as the ability to design
enterprise-level sustainable finance strategies and implement sustainability
risk management policies.



A recent study by KPMG anticipates the ASEAN sustainable finance market could
grow to S$4 to S$5 trillion over the next decade.

This projection underscores the importance of preparing over 50,000 financial
professionals to integrate sustainable finance tasks into their roles,
particularly in risk management, compliance, and client relationship sectors.

To support this skills transformation, MAS has committed S$35 million from the
Financial Sector Development Fund.

This fund will enhance the capabilities of financial professionals through a
range of new educational programmes.

Initiatives include the introduction of sustainable finance-focused
undergraduate programmes at Nanyang Technological University and the National
University of Singapore, alongside over 65 new executive courses launching this
year.

These efforts are augmented by the implementation of the IBF Skills Badge, which
will recognise professionals’ expertise in sustainable finance, aiding in
skill-based hiring and promotions.





Chia Der Jiun

Chia Der Jiun, Managing Director, MAS said,

> “ASEAN’s sizeable sustainable financing needs over the next decade present
significant opportunities for Singapore’s financial centre to support the
region’s transition to net zero.

MAS is strongly supportive of efforts across financial institutions and the
training providers to upskill the financial services sector workforce in a
timely fashion. I encourage professionals to tap on the available support and
deepen their sustainable finance capabilities to capture these opportunities.”

Aries 
You’re thinking for yourself. You may not be the pioneering type normally, but circumstances warrant it today. Being one of the sheep may feel safe and cozy but that’s not high on your list of priorities right now. 
Taurus 
You’re more tempted than usual to take some big risks. Playing it safe just seems so boring. But can you really afford to lose? Don’t just imagine all of your winnings. Be realistic. 
Gemini 
No one wants to hear you preach. It’s a shame, because you could really teach them a thing or two. You know better than to even try, though. Just sigh and continue keeping your secrets of success to yourself. 
Cancer 
Love yourself and others love you, too. You need to take care of yourself today. Money isn’t the point. Whether it’s checking into a spa or simply treating yourself to a healthy smoothie, it’s a good time to do some self-nurturing.

Libra 
Your current project is less than ideal. But you can change things for the better a lot easier than you can stew over the way things are. Start sending out some feelers. Responses will be more positive than you imagine. 
Scorpio 
You’re too old to be blaming others for your mistakes. Getting swept up in the frenzy of the moment is no excuse. Others may have led you into a financial mess but you’re the only one who can get yourself out of it. 
Sagittarius 
Being part of a mutual admiration society has its advantages. It’s just the soothing balm you need to keep on going. So surround yourself with people who like you back just as much as you like them. It’s worth more than gold. 
Capricorn 
Someone would have you believe your plans are impossible, but that’s only their view. Keep on persevering, with them or without them. If they give up, then that only means more for you when success finally arrives. 
Aquarius 
You feel trapped but the reality is that the sky’s the limit. All you need to hear is your first ’yes’ to realize this. Start organizing small groups to give you some feedback, then branch out from there.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says that it will take more time for the central bank to gain confidence that inflation will slow down to its 2% target. He says this means policies will need to be restrictive for a longer period of time, indicating that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon. 
The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at their upcoming meeting, dashing investors’ hopes of several cuts taking place this year. 
How could the economy be affected if the Fed doesn’t cut interest rates in 2024? 
Last year, indications by the central bank that there would be multiple rate cuts in 2024 buoyed the stock market to record highs. Investors were anticipating that cutting interest rates would result in higher profits for companies, and more money for people to put into the market. 
After Powell signaled that interest rates were not going down very soon, the stock market initially dipped while Treasury yields hit their highest level this year. 
If the cost of borrowing remains high, market prices are expected to slide. Speaking to CNN, finance professor Itay Goldstein says a sluggish stock market will affect the overall economy because a downturning market may end up with businesses putting off investments or employing cost-cutting measures. 
Last month, consumers in the US continued shopping despite elevated prices. However, if interest rates do not go down, shoppers might begin to hold on to their money instead of doing any retail therapy or investing it. Slowed-down spending also results in a slower economy. 
According to Goldstein, the chances of this taking place will increase if the Federal Reserve refrains from slashing interest rates in 2024.",0.04448447

2024-04-18 09:13:31,housing finance startup altum credo raises $40 mn to scale up distribution network,"VIEW SAVED STORIES
Housing finance startup Altum Credo has raised around $40 Mn (INR 334 Cr) in its Series C funding round co-led by Z3Partners and Oikocredit, with participation from British International Investment and other existing investors, including Aavishkaar Capital and Amicus Capital.
The company said that it has raised $27 Mn in equity and facilitated a partial exit to Series A investors of $13 Mn. 
Altum Credo plans to use the fresh funds to achieve AUM growth by further enhancing its distribution network and expanding its operational footprint. The round will also help the company to remain well-capitalised in the near term and support growth, it said.
Founded in 2017, Altum Credo has been enabling tech-driven affordable housing finance in the country. It is focused on the largely untapped potential of unserved and under-served segments and targets first-time homeowners. 
The company raised $9.8 Mn in its Series A funding round and $12 Mn in Series B equity funding in 2018 and 2021, respectively. 
As of March 2024, Altum Credo had an AUM of INR 830 Cr, with 93% of customers from the economically weaker section or low-income group category. Its customer base comprises salaried customers from both formal and informal segments and self-employed proprietors of small and medium enterprises who largely belong to low-income groups.

The average ticket size of its home loan portfolio is INR 8.5 Lakh, with an average tenure of 15 years. With a loan-to-value ratio below 50%, the average value of the properties the company funded is around INR 15-25 Lakh.
Vikrant Bhagwat, founder, MD and CEO of Altum Credo, said that at a time when the Indian economy is touching new heights, access to affordable housing finance has immense potential to contribute towards this growth.
“This Series C fund raise is a critical milestone for the next phase of sustainable growth and will strengthen our balance sheet enabling effective leverage and sound ALM (asset and liability management). The company will enhance its distribution network and expand operations in central and northern India,” said Bhagwat.

US job market stays strong despite widespread layoffs
Government job cuts are at the highest they’ve been since September of 2011, with the most recent wave of layoffs hitting Army and Veterans Affairs offices.
Wibbitz
Economists have been scratching their heads over how Americans can continue to prop up the economy with their spending despite high interest rates , persistent inflation , dwindling savings and rising debt .
There may be a simple answer: Jobs .
Payroll growth has been stunningly strong this year. Most people who land new jobs have been opening their wallets, with many making big lifestyle changes that include buying a new house or car, according to a recent survey by ZipRecruiter, a leading job site.
Fifty-seven percent of workers hired in the last six months ramped up their spending after they got a new position, according to the ZipRecruiter poll results, which were provided exclusively to USA TODAY. Thirty-four percent maintained their previous spending levels and 10% said they reduced their outlays.
The online survey, conducted in February and March, drew responses from 1,500 workers who started their jobs during the previous six months.
Many of those who ratchet up their purchases go big. Forty-four percent of the recent hires said they plan to upgrade their lifestyle by moving to a nicer neighborhood or larger home, buying a new house or car, or transferring their children to better schools, the survey shows.
While workers who stay in the same job and get raises also tend to spend more, those who snag new positions typically see bigger pay bumps. Of the surveyed workers who switched jobs, 70% received higher pay and half of that group notched double-digit wage gains.
What drives wage growth?
Earnings growth has surged since the pandemic because of severe labor shortages that have eased in recent months. For a couple of years, those pay increases were outpaced by inflation, leaving households struggling to keep up. Since last May, however, average pay gains have topped price increases, allowing workers to stretch their paychecks further even though pay increases have gradually slowed.
“For the past 10 months, real (inflation-adjusted) wage growth has been positive, so more workers and job switchers are seeing their purchasing power increase,” says ZipRecruiter’s chief economist Julia Pollak.
How is the job market in the USA right now?
U.S. employers added a booming 303,000 jobs in March and an average of 276,000 the first three months of the year, up from an average of 251,000 in 2022. Job growth has been expected to slow this year amid elevated inflation and interest rates. But healthy pay increases have fueled spending, which, in turn, has juiced the economy and labor market, creating a virtuous cycle.  
Sturdy job growth by itself can boost consumer purchases because more people are working. That effect is compounded if workers are shifting to higher-paying positions.
What happened with the Great Resignation?
During the Great Resignation, as record numbers of Americans changed jobs amid the labor crunch, median yearly wage growth for job switchers peaked at 16.4% In June 2022, according to payroll processor ADP. Since then, median pay increases have steadily fallen as labor shortages have waned, bottoming out at a still-solid 7.2% in January.
But pay increases have spiked again in the past two months, with the annual rise hitting 10% in March, the highest since July 2023, ADP figures show.
The surge “is a signal the labor market is still competitive amongst employers looking for talent and also lucrative for employees looking for pay increases elsewhere,” says Liv Wang, lead data scientist at the ADP Research Institute.
Job changers are scoring the biggest pay gains in construction, financial services and manufacturing, Wang says.
What are the challenges consumers face?
The willingness of new hires to splurge is more than offsetting other hurdles households face.
The Federal Reserve’s key interest rate still hovers at a 23-year high, driving up mortgage rates and other borrowing costs. Inflation is at 3.5%, still well above the Fed’s 2% goal. Americans’ pandemic-related savings have mostly run dry. And low- to middle-income households are burdened by record credit card debt.
Retire at 60? Millennials want to retire by 60. Good luck with that.
The bottom line: Even if the Fed pushes back interest rate cuts to later this year because of high inflation, the twin forces of strong job growth and consumption could keep the economy humming. Consumer spending makes up about 70% of economic activity.
A core measure of retail sales surged in March and, according to Oxford Economics, likely translates to another robust annualized consumer spending gain of 3% in the first quarter.
“If we continue to see this labor market strength, it could continue to prop up (economic) growth, Pollak says.",0.3035496

2024-04-18 09:22:04,california retains title as world’s 5th largest economy,"According to a new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week,
California remains the world’s 5th largest economy, leading sixth place India
and falling under fourth-place Japan.

The 2024 World Economic Growth Projects Report found that the United States, in
terms of Nominal GDP, was at $27.36 trillion in 2023, up from $25.7 trillion in
2022. The next closest economy, China, stood at only $17.66 trillion in 2023,
followed by Germany with $4.4 trillion and Japan with $4.2 trillion.

When broken down by individual states, California still had by far the largest
individual economy. Coming in 5th place once again, California had a $3.86
trillion economy in 2023, up from $3.64 trillion in 2022. According to the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis, the state had an overall 6.1% growth rate. The next
highest state, Texas, had a $2.56 trillion economy in 2023, coming at a slower
growth rate than California as they had been at $2.4 trillion in 2022. The third
highest state was New York, with $2.15 trillion in 2023.

2024 IMF Chart (Photo: gov.ca.gov)While many factors played against California
in recent years, such as recovery from the pandemic, many companies moving out
of state, state population losses, and massive tech job losses in the Bay Area,
the state has shown to rebound economically in recent years. A high population
mixed with many pandemic-resistant industries and many growth areas led the
state to continue to grow.

“California continues to punch above its weight, overperforming all but a
handful of the largest countries in the world,” said Governor Newsom of the
report on Wednesday. “And with our unparalleled combination of innovation,
higher education, a talented workforce, diverse industries, and unparalleled
natural resources, we will continue to do so well into the future.”

While many experts agreed that those were factors contributing to California’s
high marks, they noted that the number of overall opportunities were still
strong despite Government overview.

“Businesses in California have felt squeezed for quite some time, especially
with high taxation and more and more regulations,” explained economist Mia
Malone to the Globe on Wednesday. “But it has proved resilient to that too.
There are so many people here, so many different industries and pretty much a
bit of everything. Businesses can still succeed and grow here. Is it harder?
Yes, and some do leave. But look at all the tech firms in Silicon Valley, all
the media companies in LA, all the large warehouse and freight companies in the
Inland Empire. There’s new construction, agriculture, mining, tourism. This is
why California succeeds even with all the drawbacks. There is just so much to
build on.

“If the government reigned back a bit, the economy here would truly expand. I
mean, they are fifth in the world right now. They have a bigger economy than
India, and they have the most people in the world. That’s how productive
California is. That is how much they contribute. California is $3.86 trillion of
the U.S. $27.3 trillion economy. Very roughly, that’s 14%. That is how much of
an advantage California is at. It’s really a lot.”

2024-04-18 06:47:00,german economy minister makes unexpected visit to kyiv," German Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck unexpectedly arrived in Kyiv Thursday to discuss post-war reconstruction and show support after Russian attacks on key Ukrainian infrastructure. 
”This visit comes at a time when Ukraine needs all the support it can get in its fight for freedom,” Habeck told reporters in the Ukrainian capital. 
”And it is a fight for freedom, that’s the important thing that the world, Europe and Germany mustn’t forget,” he said, adding that Ukraine was ”fighting for the values that define Europe”. 
The trip comes after Germany at the weekend announced it was sending an additional Patriot air defence system to Ukraine after pleas from Kyiv for its Western backer to urgently help foil Russian attacks. 
Ukraine has said it is running out of weaponry to shoot down Russian missiles and drones as Moscow ramps up attacks on energy infrastructure. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday urged fellow EU leaders to urgently follow Berlin’s lead and send more air defence systems to Ukraine. 
Habeck, who was accompanied by a business delegation on the trip, will hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
He will also meet with Ukrainian officials to discuss emergency aid and business ties as well as preparations for the annual Ukraine Recovery Conference to be held in Berlin in June, the German economy ministry said in a statement. 
”Comprehensive support for Ukraine also includes support for a resilient energy supply and reconstruction. Private sector investment is crucial for this to succeed,” Habeck was quoted as saying in the statement. 
The World Bank has estimated the total cost of reconstruction facing Ukraine more than two years since the start of the war is at least $486 billion.

In the event that multiple products or services are provided to the same client or for the same eligible activity, the value of each product or service is counted towards the sustainable finance commitment, which encourages the active participation of multiple business units at CIBC in supporting our sustainable finance goal. When appropriate, we utilize a modified third-party league table methodology to attribute CIBC’s share of the transaction depending upon CIBC’s role, which for syndicated loans, M&A advisory, and debt and equity underwritings, in which we act as a lead or co-lead, could result in amounts being counted not directly financed or facilitated by CIBC. For transactions involving foreign exchange conversion, we have applied a fixed internal advised rate. The methodology applied to our 2023 and cumulative progress was established in 2018 and subsequently updated in 2021, 2022, and 2023 to reflect changing market practices and industry guidelines. In March 2024, we published our updated 2024 Sustainable Finance Methodology, which is effective prospectively for eligible transactions that close on or after November 1, 2023.

Sustainability-linked financial products are designed to incentivize the client to achieve pre-determined ESG targets with pricing implications (for example, linkages to interest charged or credited). Our sustainability-linked financial products are aligned to relevant guidelines, principles, and frameworks such as the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association, Loan Market Association, Loan Syndications, and Trading Association Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles or International Capital Markets Association Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles. The products and services offered by CIBC included in our sustainable finance commitment include loans and loan syndications, debt and equity underwritings, M&A advisory, and principal investments. Loans and investments that enable affordable housing activities also meet our obligations under the U.S. Community Reinvestment Act. In 2023, our methodology was updated prospectively to include transactions relating to securitization. We did not restate our cumulative performance from 2018 to 2022.

WASHINGTON, April 18 (Reuters) - South Africa will use future drawdowns of its Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account to curb its debt burden, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said, adding he was pondering tax hikes and expenditure cuts in the next post-election budget. 
Africa’s most industrialised nation is grappling with an ailing economy and high debt ahead of a general election on May 29 that could see the governing African National Congress party lose its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of apartheid 30 years ago. 
Earlier this year, the government announced a change to the framework governing the so-called GFECRA account that captures gains and losses to foreign currency reserve transactions, allowing for a drawdown of 150 billion rand ($8 billion) over the next three years. 
”Eskom is out, or Transnet,” Godongwana told Reuters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meeting, ruling out financial support from the account for the country’s ailing state-energy firms. 
”Debt service costs now have emerged the highest expenditure item - therefore that is a red flag.” 
Other measures were also on the horizon a bit further out. The country’s next 2025/2026 budget - scheduled for February next year - could also see more pronounced adjustments than the last one, the minister said. 
”If you want to do a fiscal consolidation you must do it far away from the election, and the timing for us is the budget that we will table on the 19th February 2025,” said Godongwana, when asked about the absence of significant expenditure reductions in the recent budget. 
The next budget, nearly a year down the line, must send a signal and timeline by which fiscal consolidation would be concluded, the minister added. 
”Now that is going to require maybe well that we cut expenditure and maybe well that we tweak some taxes - it could be a combination of both,” he said. 
Another push the government would focus on in the months to come was consolidating the plethora of social spending measures and grants, said Godongwana. 
Prospects for economic growth, currently forecast at 1.6% for 2024, could face headwinds if loadshedding were to intensify or Middle East tension to escalate. 
”I factor in that there is a possibility of downside risks.” 
However, the recent droughts that have wreaked havoc across much of Sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa itself, would have no impact on food inflation, at least for now, he said.

While BTC faces challenges around block size limits, wallet / exchange congestion, and reduced block rewards, BSV is rolling out a future-proof strategy, dedicated to meeting industry demands, via nano transaction fees, big blocks, and unbounded scale. 
The BSV Association’s R&D team recently announced its ground-breaking protocol update, Teranode, features greater network efficiency and speed, pushing transaction volume to 1,100,000 per second / 86,000,000,000 transactions in 24 hours. This demonstrates BSV’s commitment to delivering a scalable blockchain with faster, inexpensive, and secure transactions. 
By shifting the focus from block rewards to transaction fees as the primary incentive for miners, BSV offers a sustainable revenue stream without imposing high costs and data caps. 
Industry experts such as Siggi Óskarsson, Teranode Director at BSV Association, and Kurt Wuckert Jr., Co-Founder of the mining company Gorilla Pool, believe that BSV Teranode’s unbounded scaling potential can transform today’s blockchain economy and digital futures.

2024-04-18 12:46:54,"alternative data rise: fintech innovation with sean adler, gzi finance","In a new episode of the Disruption Interruption Podcast, host Karla Jo Helms
interviews Sean Adler, a trailblazer in the financial technology sector and
founder and CEO of GZI, an award-winning alternative data platform that
translates scientific innovation into financial technology. They delve into the
evolving landscape of alternative data and its increasing prominence in the
financial markets. The dialogue sheds light on the trajectory of alternative
data from its inception to its potential integration into mainstream financial
practices. 

Alternative Data refers to non-traditional data sets that investors use to guide
investment strategy, examples being credit card transactions, mobile device
data, satellite imagery, social media sentiment, product reviews, weather data,
web traffic, and app usage. The number of alternative-data providers is more
than 20 times larger now than it was 30 years ago — with more than 400 currently
active providers, compared to only 20 in 1990. A survey by the Alternative
Investment Management Association (AIMA) found that 34 percent of hedge fund
managers surveyed said their firms are newly investing in alternative data.1 In
an educational discussion with Karla Jo (KJ) Helms, the host of the Disruption
Interruption podcast, Sean Adler—a versatile leader with a solid background in
international tech startups, biotech, and fintech—offers insights into the
intricate world of alternative data and its burgeoning influence on financial
markets and biotech sectors. “Analyzing the effectiveness of alternative data is
paramount,” Adler emphasizes. “It’s not just about the data itself, but how it’s
interpreted and utilized.” He alludes to the fact that, while alternative data
has gained traction, it is still in the process of being integrated more deeply
into financial operations.

Fintech and Alternative Data

Fintech is a combination of the words “financial technology”—a catch-all term
for technology used to augment, streamline, digitize, or disrupt traditional
financial services.2 It refers to software, algorithms, and applications for
both desktop and mobile.

With an astute focus on fintech’s revolution, Adler and KJ navigate the complex
terrain of alternative data, from satellite imagery to mobile app analytics.
They unpack the challenges of defining this emerging field, emphasizing the
imperative of effective utilization.

Adler sheds light on the significance of alternative data in the financial
services industry and how it presents a paradigm shift in decision-making
processes, drawing from diverse sources such as tweet scores and credit card
data.

Reshaping FinTech through Alternative Data 

With a keen eye on the future, Adler unveils the transformative potential of
alternative data in reshaping the fintech landscape and revolutionizing
traditional investment strategies. In discussing the tokenization of assets to
the emergence of asset-backed cryptocurrencies, he hints at a future where
data-driven innovation reigns supreme and becomes a cornerstone of
decision-making across industries. He discusses the potential applications of
alternative data beyond the financial sector, suggesting its relevance for
enterprise expansion and analysis. He emphasizes the importance of understanding
client needs to tailor data offerings effectively.

Reflecting on the future of his company GZI Finance, he expressed openness to
exploration and collaboration, inviting feedback and engagement from interested
parties with a focus on building mutually beneficial relationships. “We
anticipate alternative data becoming more prevalent in the coming years,” shared
Adler. “Understanding the market needs and designing products accordingly will
be instrumental in this transition.”

BERLIN, April 18 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Christian Lindner rejected on Thursday Brazil’s proposal to tax the super-rich. 
”We do not think it is suitable,” he said in a panel discussion alongside Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel in Washington DC. ”We have an appropriate taxation of income.” Brazil, heading the presidency of the Group of Twenty (G20), is aiming to build international consensus on the taxation of wealth this year, and is pushing for a joint declaration at a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in July. 
While Lindner is sceptical about the proposal, his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire, has showed support for it. 
On Wednesday, Le Maire said that moving to tax the rich was the logical next step for a series of global taxation reforms launched in 2017, including agreement on a global corporate minimum tax. 
He said the G20 should aim to reach an agreement on taxing the rich by 2027. (Reporting by Christian Kraemer and Maria Martinez, Editing by Rachel More and Madeline Chambers)",0.26069632
2024-04-18 12:48:06,jamie dimon knew subprime 'could go up in smoke'; now he's worried about an artificial economy 'fueled by government deficit spending'," In the chaos of the 2008 recession, perhaps no bank stood more prepared than Jamie Dimon’s J.P Morgan Chase & Co. JPM. 
In advance of the crisis, Jamie Dimon realized that ”underwriting standards were deteriorating across the industry,” with late payments on subprime loans rising. 
In late 2006, the bank led his firm to exit Wall Street’s hot subprime business, starting with a frantic call made to J.P. Morgan’s vacationing Chief of Securitized Products where he said, ”I really want you to watch out for subprime! We need to sell a lot of our positions. I’ve seen it before. This stuff could go up in smoke!” 
Don’t Miss: 
By getting out of the soon-to-be toxic products, J.P. Morgan was able to go on the offensive when other banks pulled back too late or were forced into bankruptcy. 
J.P. Morgan’s stock has risen nearly 260% from its pre-global-financial-crisis peak. 
Reflecting on the recession, Dimon said ”counter to what most people think, many of the extreme actions we took were not done to make a profit; they were done to support our country and the financial system.” 
Dimon is sounding the alarm on a debt-fueled economy appearing healthier than reality may be. 
Trending: This ‘Future of Gaming’ startup disrupting a $272 billion industry is now letting anyone invest for a limited time. 
In his most recent annual shareholder letter, Dimon said, ”The U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending. and the markets currently expect a soft landing.” However, he offered this caveat, saying that ”it is important to note that the economy is being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus.” 
With the U.S. national debt already surpassing $34.6 trillion at a time when the Federal Reserve is still unable to cut interest rates in the face of stubborn inflation, interest payments on the debt are set to exceed U.S. defense spending this year. 
Whether the increasing fiscal debt becomes a problem impacting broader markets to the extent that the subprime crisis did remains to be seen, but Dimon and his firm are prepared for anything with J.P. Morgan’s self-described ”fortress balance sheet.”

FILE - Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, speaks in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 17, 2024. During a IMF and World Bank meeting Thursday, April 18, 2024, Georgieva said the world economy has proven surprisingly resilient in the face of higher interest rates and the shock of war in Ukraine and Gaza, but ”there is plenty to worry about,’’ including stubborn inflation and rising levels of government debt. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)
WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that the world economy has proven surprisingly resilient in the face of higher interest rates and the shock of war in Ukraine and Gaza , but ”there is plenty to worry about,’’ including stubborn inflation and rising levels of government debt.
“ Inflation is down but not gone,’’ Kristalina Georgieva told reporters at the spring meeting of the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank. In the United States, she said, “the flipside’’ of unexpectedly strong economic growth is that it ”taking longer than expected’’ to bring inflation down.
Georgieva also warned that government debts are growing around the world. Last year, they ticked up to 93% of global economic output — up from 84% in 2019 before the response to the COVID-19 pandemic pushed governments to spend more to provide healthcare and economic assistance. She urged countries to more efficiently collect taxes and spend public money. ”In a world where the crises keep coming, countries must urgently build fiscal resilience to be prepared for the next shock,’’ she said.
On Tuesday, the IMF said it expects to the global economy to grow 3.2% this year, a modest upgrade from the forecast it made in January and unchanged from 2023. It also expects a third straight year of 3.2% growth in 2025.
PUBLICIDAD
The world economy has proven unexpectedly sturdy, but it remains weak by historical standards: Global growth averaged 3.8% from 2000 to 2019.
One reason for sluggish global growth, Georgieva said, is disappointing improvement in productivity. She said that countries had not found ways to most efficiently match workers and technology and that years of low interest rates — that only ended after inflation picked up in 2021 — had allowed ”firms that were not competitive to stay afloat.’’
She also cited in many countries an aging ”labor force that doesn’t bring the dynamism’’ needed for faster economic growth.
The United States has been an exception to the weak productivity gains over the past year. Compared to Europe, Georgieva said, America makes it easier for businesses to bring innovations to the marketplace and has lower energy costs.
She said countries could help their economies by slashing bureaucratic red tape and getting more women into the job market.

2024-04-18 13:48:00,2nd annual marion county developer’s conference stresses collaboration to grow economy," Apr. 18—FAIRMONT — Marion County stands to benefit from growth in surrounding counties, but much of it depends on investing in people, according to WVU Economist John Deskins. 
Deskins, director of the Bureau of Business and Academic Research, gave the morning keynote speech that kicked off the Discover Marion County Developers Conference held at Fairmont State University and hosted by the Marion County Chamber of Commerce. 
”We are not out of the woods in West Virginia,” Pat Snively, president of the Marion County Chamber of Commerce, said. ”We have a lot of issues as a state that we need to work on. Certainly, people talk about West Virginia being 49th or 50th in a lot of those key indicators. But overall, I think John has provided a brighter potential than folks realize here in Marion County.” 
Deskins compared the last three years of economic data against the data from 2006 to the last year of the pre-COVID era in 2019. In the stretch from 2006 to 2019, Marion County’s economic growth declined. However, since 2021 it’s a different story as the county’s growth is moving upward. Unemployment is low across the county but more importantly, workforce participation is high, meaning more people here are engaging with the labor market than in other parts of the Mountain State. 
”That’s a good thing,” Deskins said. ”That’s a very important thing for showcasing that we have the people needed to bring business to Marion County.” 
On the downside, the annual median income in Marion County is lower per person than surrounding counties, such as Monongalia. The bright side to that, Deskins said, is that the cost of starting or moving a business here is lower than in other areas, which could attract developers. 
Although the state as a whole is developing, a lot of that development is clustered in specific areas around the state, Deskins said. Part of the challenge is to ensure adjoining counties are pulled up by counties where economic activity is focused. Marion County is in the right place to begin attracting new development, he said. 
However, to truly take advantage of that positioning, the county and state need to invest in its residents so they have access to a good education and can address drug addiction within their community. Businesses want a lot of things, such as access to highways, low electric rates and low cost of doing business. However, without the ability to tap into a ready pool of workers, there’s no point in coming here, Deskins said. 
”Business absolutely demands — this is something we have to focus more on in West Virginia — making sure we can convince businesses that they can find an educated and trained workforce in West Virginia,” he said. 
Having the right workforce means not only improving educational outcomes, but overall health ones as well. Only a quarter of the state’s population has a college degree, and diseases such as cancer, diabetes and obesity keep people out of the labor force. Substance abuse is another area in which progress needs to be made because it remains a major impediment for bringing businesses to the state, he said. 
Drug abuse also contributes to a vicious cycle. Drugs are used as an escape from a lack of economic opportunities, but companies won’t bring opportunities where drug use is rampant because the labor force won’t be reliable. In turn, this dynamic leads to a lack of economic opportunities fueling drug use, leading a cycle that feeds on itself. 
Deskins provided a bird’s eye view of the economy as a whole. 
Despite fears of recession over the past few years, most of the risk has dissipated, Deskins said. A recession looks unlikely, and instead the country as a whole is poised for growth. The rub is economic growth will happen slowly throughout 2024 and 2025. Although economic headwinds in the form of inflation and supply chain shortages are easing, they are still having an effect on the country’s growth. 
Inflation, which Deskins called the biggest issue nationally, improved substantially from 2022, but is still not where it should be, he said. In 2022, inflation hit a 40-year high. He predicts the battle against inflation will last through the end of the year, when the rate shaves off the last percentage point before reaching its target. Big picture wise, the national economy is due for a soft landing, from which West Virginia will benefit. 
The state’s economy reflects some of these larger trends. West Virginia’s GDP growth outperformed the national average in 2023 for the first time in several years. Deskins acknowledged the importance of coal and the energy sector for that growth, but emphasized that it’s important to diversify the economy. He said the state should grow the areas in which it has a comparative advantage. 
Comparative advantage is an Economics 101 principle that says countries should compete where they have the lowest opportunity costs. For example, West Virginia should grow its tourism industry because of the natural beauty here. A state like North Dakota does not have the advantage of natural beauty, so it would be inefficient to grow a tourism industry there. It could, but it would be more expensive for it to do so compared to West Virginia, which already has a built in advantage. 
Matt Borror, who works in the business retention and expansion at the West Virginia Economic Development Office, said economic development is important because it plays a role in improving the quality of life for the state’s residents. Part of that is getting people to want to move here, and it can’t be done without creating opportunities for people to move to. 
One of the major hurdles Borror’s sees is keeping young people in the state, another issue Deskins touched on when discussing the factors impacting the state’s development as a whole. 
”There is a lack of awareness of what companies here need jobs filled,” Borror said. ”A lot of time it’s awareness to the parents as well. Making it known that these jobs are available in West Virginia.” 
He said educating the public about well-paying jobs in the state is important. It’s an issue Borror works on from his office. 
”Connecting the dots is a big part of our role,” he said. 
Snively said one big takeaway from the presentation was the need to work collaboratively to tackle the challenges impeding economic growth in Marion County. One person or Chamber can’t do it alone. 
”I think there is potential to work our way away from those things that have been detractors in the past,” Snively said. ”We have so much potential here. If people can look at the positive and work towards potential growth, then I think the sky’s the limit for Marion County.”

2024-04-18 15:36:31,china’s economy in 3 charts," The Chinese government’s report for the first quarter of 2024 was a mixed bag of cause for optimism and systemic issues that continue to drag on economic growth. 
Newsweek charts based on the latest data from China’s National Statistics Bureau illustrate three key bellwethers of the world’s second-largest economy. 
According to the new data, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.3 percent year over year, slightly higher than Q4 2023 and beating many economists’ expectations. 
Though early, the figure would seem to put the economy on the right track to meet the annual target of ”around 5 percent” growth announced by China’s cabinet-like State Council last month. 
However, the figure belies the fact that the growth seen in several sectors of the economy, such as exports, was frontloaded in the first two months of the year and off by March. 
Then there’s China’s GDP numbers themselves that many, including China’s former No. 2 Li Keqiang, have called into doubt. 
Economist George Magnus, associate at the University of Oxford China Centre, told Newsweek on Thursday that he believes China’s long-term growth rate is now around the 3 percent mark. 
The unemployment rate for the first quarter averaged 5.3 percent, continuing the trend of between 5 percent and 5.3 percent since early last year. 
China calculates its quarterly unemployment averages as a percentage of unemployed persons relative to the sum of the unemployed and employed segments of the population. 
Notably, China’s unemployment reports do not account for those living in rural areas, which comprise about one-third of the population. 
A separate report released by the statistics bureau on Thursday broke down the nation’s employment situation by age. 
The report posted 7.2 percent unemployment rate for the 25- to 29-year-old demographic and a lower-than-average 4.2 percent for those between 30 and 59. 
Joblessness among Chinese youth remains high, despite central government initiatives introduced last year to create internships and public-sector job opportunities. Thursday’s report posted 15.3 percent unemployment for the 15- to 24-year-old group, matching February’s rate and 0.7 points higher than January’s. 
The figures are an improvement over those in the first half of 2023, however. 
After last June’s numbers (21.3 percent youth unemployment), Beijing ceased reporting on the issue. Six months later, reports resumed, based on new methodology that excluded rural dwellers and those who have given up looking for work. 
A housing market crunch continues to loom as China seeks to emerge from its post-pandemic economic malaise. This weighs particularly heavy on China considering that the sector accounts for 30 percent of the economy and 70 percent of household wealth. 
The Q1 report showed investment in real estate development to be down 9.5 percent since the same period last year. 
Total sales of new commercial buildings fell by 27.6 percent and sales of new commercial floor space by 19.4 percent, an indication that prices are not yet believed to have bottomed out. 
With the collapse of China’s property bubble still in recent memory, risk-averse policymakers have so far not moved to lend a helping hand to indebted real state giants and local governments. 
Newsweek reached out to the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. for comment.

2024-04-17 19:52:09,"the economy might be booming, but housing is in a recession: top real estate ceo says he’s never seen anything like it in 20 years"," Fortune· Chris Goodney—Bloomberg/Getty Images 
Glenn Kelman is the chief executive of Redfin, a self-described technology-powered real estate company, a modern way to buy and sell homes. He’s been at the helm for almost two decades and doesn’t seem to have lost his zeal, not during the Great Financial Crisis, not now; he calls himself the luckiest person in the world. 
It can’t be easy. Redfin stock reached a high of more than $95 per share during the pandemic and its corresponding housing boom, but it’s trended downward ever since, landing at around $5.50. It’s been a rough ride; revenue dropped last year, and agents were cut. It goes beyond Redfin; all of the housing world suffered as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. “Losing 40% of our agents is a tragedy,” Kelman told Fortune. “I feel personally responsible for it. I was the one who signed their offer letters in spirit, if not, in fact. And I failed to grow the business to the extent that we could keep them all busy … It’s just hard when the number of homes sold in the United States drops from 6 million to 4 million.” 
Last year, existing home sales fell to their lowest point in almost 30 years. The housing market froze, and it’s only just begun to thaw. Mortgage rates were the highest they’ve been in more than 20 years, and they’ve come down since, but are still high compared with those of the pandemic. In the past week or so, mortgage rates surged again, reaching their highest level in months, 7.50%. Home prices are high, too. “The cost of buying a home has gone up again, and prices haven’t come down,” Kelman said. “So the Fed keeps trying to tame inflation with rate increases, but at least one sector is untamable, and that is housing.” 
It’s anxiety-inducing, he said. Housing is a basic need, and would-be buyers who held out last year are tired of waiting. Millennials who’ve delayed starting a family, putting off plans, can only wait so long, Kelman said. He’s never seen anything like it, calling it the “worst situation” for the housing market. “Housing is in this recession, and the rest of the economy is booming,” he said. 
“I was the CEO during the Great Financial Crisis,” he continued. “Sales volume went down but prices did, too.” One problem fixed another, Kelman said. Usually when sales decline, prices drop too, and then sales increase later—that’s the cycle, he said. Homes become affordable again, and sales pick up because of it. This situation is very different. Interest rates are up, and sales volume has fallen through the floor, as he put it, but home prices haven’t followed. “Some of that is just this artifact of 30-year mortgages,” he said. Everything the Federal Reserve is doing has no real effect on homeowners, apart from keeping them where they are. “It actually has the perverse effect of keeping home prices high,” Kelman explained. 
He doesn’t know that mortgage rates will go up significantly through the end of this year; they could even come down, depending on inflation. He thinks sales will improve, and they’ve already been better than he’s expected. That’s because people need homes—it’s not a “fad to own a house,” and there’s a “deep-seated human need to own a home, where you’re going to raise your family,” he said. Still, the problem goes beyond the latest spell of unaffordability, and has more to do with building homes. 
“For the longest time, housing was getting very expensive, but money was getting cheaper,” Kelman said, and a product of the pandemic made it so people could move anywhere they wanted: remote work. Californians became Texans and Floridians, but all the buffers are gone, he said. The people who were going to move already have, and money isn’t cheap anymore. The only way to solve the problem is by building homes. 
“The basis of the American dream was that there was more land here than there was in Europe,” he said. “And for the longest time, the government was very aggressive, working with builders to create more housing.” But eventually that changed, with what Kelman called well-meaning laws to protect the environment and give people more control over what kind of housing was built in their neighborhoods. That backfired, and it became much harder to build anything. “The left, as well as the right, have really struggled to solve the affordability crisis,” he said. 
California is probably ground zero, Kelman said. For years, its housing crisis worsened because of policy failures and unfettered local control. Initiatives were drawn up to change local regulations surrounding land use, and they failed time and time again. But finally, they didn’t. Kelman said it’s an encouraging sign, and finally people are talking about housing at all levels of government because something needs to be done. “Biden’s basic problem with millennials is how optimistic can you be about the economy from your parents’ basement?” Kelman said. 
‘If we were completely undressed in public, we would have nothing to fear’ 
Apart from deteriorated affordability, there’s another thing that’s rocked the housing world: the National Association of Realtors’ $418 million settlement. “NAR had to settle—it was existential,” Kelman said. “Every judgment in the Missouri case had gone against them, and that was a precedent that other courts would follow, so they had to.” 
Redfin’s commissions model has always been different from, and lower than, the industry standard, so it’s not clear what will change at the company. The “opacity of pricing in the real estate industry,” he suggested, might have actually kept people from selling and buying with Redfin. 
“Our great frustration as a business has been normally, when you offer better service for less money, the world beats a path to your door,” he said. “And Redfin has grown from zero to a billion dollars on that premise. And yet, I think we could have grown more if consumers were value driven … The more clearly buyers understand the value of what we offer, the more sales we’ll get.” 
Even so, Kelman said he doesn’t know that the housing market will be affected following the settlement. If anything, the change in commissions seems to benefit sellers; it won’t make housing more affordable. He’s not endorsing the settlement by any means, because for one, it still needs to be approved—and there’s no way to know for sure how everything will shake out. Of course, Redfin is facing its own commissions lawsuits. He wouldn’t comment on whether he’s at all worried; instead he said the company was in a good position and that its sole existence for 18 years has been to give people a better deal. “If the world knew more about Redfin, if we were completely undressed in public, we would have nothing to fear,” he said. 
While Kelman holds a 2% stake in Redfin, he is the lowest paid person on his executive team. He takes home $300,000 a year in a cash salary, and requests that he only get a bonus if positive net income is achieved, basically if the company makes money after paying expenses, which it hasn’t in the past three years. It’s not often you see that. 
“My board asks me that question every year,” he said. “I don’t really know what to say. I feel like I’ve made a king’s ransom off this company. I’m the luckiest person in the world to be able to run it, and what’s wrong with America is that so many capitalists are really engaged in a form of plunder. And I don’t know how to lead except by example.”

2024-04-18 16:36:42,the growing impact of renewable energy jobs on the economy of northern los angeles,"UNITED STATES—The renewable energy sector in California is poised for remarkable
growth in the coming years, with California’s Antelope Valley region, just north
of Los Angeles, emerging as a significant hub for clean energy development. A
recent report by the Staffing Industries Association (SIA) predicts a surge in
job opportunities within the renewable energy industry globally, with much of
this growth focussed in solar-forward “hubs” like the Antelope Valley region. In
2022, the state already boasted a significant workforce in the energy sector,
with over 911,345 workers employed. (Notably, more than 76% of the electric
power generation workforce in California was dedicated to wind, solar, and
hydroelectric power).

But Solar power in particular is experiencing unprecedented growth, outpacing
uptake of other renewable energy sources. According to the same SIA report,
solar accounted for 44% of all renewable energy jobs in 2023 and is projected to
create nearly 75% of all new renewable energy jobs through 2030. One of the
reasons behind this rapid growth is the versatility of solar installations,
which can be deployed by both individual residential consumers and utility-scale
projects, making it one of the few renewable sectors accessible to the average
person rather than exclusively in the purview of industries or the state.

But why California? Two major factors have contributed to the development of the
solar state:

1) Incentives and Government Initiatives

The implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act has accelerated opportunities
in the clean energy sector, attracting an estimated $21.2 billion in investment
for large-scale clean power generation and storage projects in California by
2030. Currently, California ranks as the second-largest generator of renewable
electricity in the nation, with over 33 GW of solar, wind, and storage capacity
already in place. Moreover, plans for an additional 8 GW of clean energy
capacity are underway, demonstrating a commitment to further expansion.

The Inflation Reduction Act also includes tax credits aimed at incentivizing
investment in wind and solar energy, which are expected to lead to significant
cost reductions. Projections suggest that the costs of solar and wind power will
decrease by 24% and 35%, respectively, over the next 30 years in California.
Residential rooftop solar, in particular, is expected to become 60% cheaper by
2050.

The Self Generating Incentive Program (SGIP) has also increased interest in
Solar in CA. While the incentive is for home batteries, for many homeowners
looking at a battery is either an entry point to considering solar, or so
crucial that they are unwilling to consider solar without a battery. BNN
Bloomberg states that in California around 85% of solar sales featured solar and
storage systems for the last two quarters, up from 20% last year.

2) Sunlight and Weather

California’s sunny weather has traditionally made it an ideal location for solar
energy adoption. With abundant and consistent levels of sunlight throughout the
year, the state offers favorable conditions for generating solar power.
Consequently, many homeowners have been drawn to the idea of harnessing solar
energy to reduce their reliance on the traditional grid and lower their
electricity bills.

In addition, the intermittent nature of California’s grid energy, exacerbated by
weather-related disruptions, has further incentivized homeowners to invest in
solar energy systems and increasingly home storage or even solar home
generators. By generating their own electricity through solar panels, homeowners
can mitigate the impact of grid outages and ensure a more stable power supply,
especially during times of high demand or grid strain.

However, recent policy changes have introduced challenges to the growth of
rooftop solar installations in California. The California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) ended the state’s net metering policies in 2022, which
previously incentivized homeowners to invest in solar panels by compensating
them for excess power fed back into the grid. The replacement of net metering
with a “net billing tariff” has led to a decline in rooftop solar project sales
by approximately 80%.

Despite these challenges, the momentum for solar energy remains strong.
California continues to lead the nation in small-scale solar power generation,
with a recent report highlighting its impressive growth over the past decade.
However, there is still untapped potential, and policymakers must ensure that
state policies support robust rooftop solar growth to realize California’s solar
energy goals.

The renewable energy sector, particularly solar power, is driving significant
economic growth in the region just north of Los Angeles. With supportive
policies and continued investment, the Antelope Valley area is well-positioned
to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the clean energy transition,
creating jobs, reducing emissions, and bolstering the local economy in the
process.

Share
LONDON (Reuters) -     Police have re-arrested Peter Murrell, the husband of former Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon, in an ongoing investigation into the finances of her pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), the BBC and other media reported on Thursday.
Police Scotland said, without naming Murrell, that a 59-year-old man was being questioned after being re-arrested in the SNP investigation.
The SNP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sturgeon, who served as Scotland’s First Minister from 2014 until her resignation in February last year, was also arrested last year as part of the same probe and then released without charge. She has denied any wrongdoing.
The investigation is looking at what happened to more than 600,000 pounds ($754,140) in funding raised by Scottish independence campaigners in 2017 which was supposed to have been ring-fenced, but may have been used for other purposes.
Murrell, who was formerly the SNP’s chief executive, was previously arrested in April last year.

2024-04-18 17:17:20,nicola sturgeon’s husband peter murrell re-arrested amid police investigation into snp funding and finances,"Nicola Sturgeon’s husband Peter Murrell, who is a former SNP chief executive,
has been re-arrested amid a police investigation into the party’s funding and
finances.

It comes more than a year after Mr Murrell, 59, was first arrested and released
without charge, which saw the couple’s home searched by police and a blue
forensics tent erected outside the property.

On Thursday, Police Scotland said: “The man, who was previously arrested as a
suspect on 5 April 2023, was taken into custody at 9.13am and is being
questioned by Police Scotland detectives.

“The matter remains active for the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981
and the public are therefore advised to exercise caution if discussing it on
social media.

“As the investigation is ongoing we are unable to comment further at this time.”

The police inquiry – dubbed Operation Branchform – has been ongoing since July
2021.

Ex-party treasurer MSP Colin Beattie has been arrested and released as part of
the probe, as has former first minister and ex-SNP leader Ms Sturgeon.

Following her arrest in June 2023, Ms Sturgeon said: “The thing that sustains me
right now is the certainty that I have done nothing wrong.”

The SNP previously said it was “cooperating fully” with the probe and would
continue to do so.

The long-running inquiry is linked to the spending of around £600,000 raised by
SNP supporters to be earmarked for Scottish independence campaigning. It is
understood there have been complaints the ringfenced cash has been used
improperly by being spent elsewhere.

In July last year, then Police Scotland chief constable Sir Iain Livingstone
said Operation Branchform had “moved beyond what some of the initial reports
were”.

He said he would not put an “absolute timeframe” on the length of the
investigation, but that it would be “proportionate and timeous”.

Mr Murrell stepped down as SNP chief executive in March 2023 after more than 20
years in the role.

His resignation came amid the party leadership contest to replace his wife after
it was revealed SNP membership numbers had dropped by around 30,000 since 2021.

The SNP previously called the reports “both malicious and wholly inaccurate”.
Shouldering the blame for the party’s responses to the media over membership
numbers, Mr Murrell admitted: “While there was no intent to mislead, I accept
that this has been the outcome.”

Image:
Police also searched the SNP headquarters in Edinburgh. Pic: PA

Following Mr Murrell’s arrest last year, the SNP’s headquarters in Edinburgh was
searched, and a camper van, thought to be worth around £110,000, was seized from
outside the Fife home of his mother.

Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said the re-arrest of Mr Murrell was
“an extremely serious development”.

The Tory MSP said: “It’s essential that all SNP staff and politicians, past and
present, cooperate fully with Police Scotland.”

He added that “this complex investigation has been going on for three years and
it’s vital that the SNP are fully open and transparent so that the police can
finally conclude their probe”.

Scottish Labour deputy leader Dame Jackie Baillie said: “This is another
incredibly concerning development in this long-running investigation.

“It is essential that Police Scotland is able to proceed with this investigation
without interference.”

2024-04-18 17:24:46,google’s restructuring shows ai’s impact on finance function," Amid a changing business landscape, digital innovation is reshaping the growth calculus for organizations. 
And with the news Wednesday (April 17) that Google CFO Ruth Porat is restructuring the tech giant’s finance team as the company looks to redistribute resources toward artificial intelligence (AI), the impact of embracing a more technology-driven approach is top of mind for the finance functions and chief financial officers of enterprises both large and small.  
That’s because today’s CFOs are increasingly finding themselves at the forefront of digital transformation, acting as key decision-makers in investing in technologies that add value to their business and its stakeholders. 
After all, where a business spends its money tends to inform, if not represent, its go-forward strategy, and areas like liquidity management, working capital management, compliance, cybersecurity, and fraud prevention are more important than ever. Businesses working with legacy functions across these areas can find themselves bogged down in manual tasks and left vulnerable to nimbler and more agile competitors. 
By harnessing innovative technologies like AI, CFOs can drive operational excellence, optimize resource allocation, and deliver unparalleled value to key stakeholders — particularly when digital investments are made against a backdrop of long-term enterprise growth objectives. 
“As a CFO, being on top of current technology is really important structurally for so many areas of the business,” Anna Brunelle, CFO at May Mobility, told PYMNTS this past February.  
And as PYMNTS has long been covering, the emergence of sophisticated tools and digital technologies has revolutionized finance operations. Automation, data analytics, and AI are increasingly combining to enable modern CFOs to streamline existing processes, gain deeper insights from cross-departmental information centers, and make data-driven decisions in real time and with greater efficiency. 
“Turning to automation transformed our finance department,” LiquidX CFO Abhishek Khandelwal told PYMNTS. “Things that used to take hours, for example analysts spending around 80% of their time pulling data and not analyzing it, are much more streamlined. It has totally transformed jobs, freeing up valuable time for more strategic exercises.” 
Looking ahead, Khandelwal noted that considering advances in AI capabilities, “reporting through an Excel spreadsheet or a PDF document or even a dashboard is going to be outdated. People will have access to real-time data through a gen AI interface. They can type in any question that they want and get an answer right away… If you want to retain good talent in today’s environment, you cannot give them something to do that is, for lack of a better word, boring.” 
While the traditional responsibilities of finance teams, including cash management, internal and external reporting, talent development, risks and controls, and scenario planning aren’t going away any time soon, implementing digital tools can provide a step function increase in workflow output. 
“Technology-driven growth, especially artificial intelligence, especially automation, these are things that as a finance department that we can really leverage,” PayByPhone Chief Financial Officer Nick Hamill told PYMNTS. 
Echoing that sentiment, Scott Casey, CFO at Robin AI, told PYMNTS that, “It’s a lot easier to get up and running quickly now with things that give you a much better view of your business … and those tools have enabled finance to even accelerate the value that they can bring to the whole company.” 
When it comes to leveraging innovation for enterprise growth, as Amy Wang, CFO at Procurify, told PYMNTS, “It’s still building out for scale, but instead of scaling with headcount, which we’ve traditionally been doing as a finance organization, it’s scaling with technology and leaning into automation.” 
Still, it is important for finance leaders to remember that automated tools like AI are only as good as their implementation, and a poorly implemented solution can end up being worse than doing things the old-fashioned way. After all, automating an inefficient process only results in more inefficiencies, not the streamlining of them. 
“The finance function has been dealing with AI for some time. I don’t want to say we’re the tip of the spear on this, but tools such as expense management tools in the accounting function [have long been built on AI],” Jim Sparks, CFO at Kalderos, told PYMNTS . “In a perfect world, I think artificial intelligence won’t replace humans, but it will make humans more effective by unlocking insights and making projections more accurate.” 
At the end of the day, like all investments, the adoption of AI within the finance office needs to be measured and implemented as appropriate. It would be foolish of CFOs to simply chase after what’s new just because of the buzz surrounding it versus any defined business goal.",0.1619926

April 18 (Reuters) - Turkey’s monetary policy set in place is fully functional and the policy mix going forward will be more supportive, but more time is needed to see its effects and convince society at large, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Thursday.
”We’re doing all the right things, we’re on the right track, but we need time to show results, to convince the broader society,” Simsek said at an event on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank spring meetings in Washington.
Simsek said part of the structural transformation of Turkey’s economy goes along with a new industrial policy, which he said will be ”pretty transparent and rules-based.”
”We want to channel resources to more productive areas, to reduce our carbon footprint, to make the economy more competitive, but also to see how we can enhance growth potential to higher productivity,” Simsek said.
”When it comes to economic complexity, we know where we stand in the value chain. We’re not where we would like to be, and that’s why the reform comes in.”

2024-04-18 18:47:58,design is poised to contribute to saudi arabia’s economy," MILAN — When French design collective Hall Haus traveled to Saudi Arabia to begin Haus Dari, a modern-Majlis-type seating system that mimics desert dunes, settling on the approach and seeing their creation come to fruition took a good six weeks. 
Started in 2020 by Zakari Boukhari, Sammy Bernoussi, Teddy Sanches and Abdoulaye Niang, the firm’s design ethos is based on its diverse mix of backgrounds, influenced by hip-hop culture, fashion, art and architecture. “We didn’t know anything about Saudi manufacturing, it was a challenge but in the end, we learned about them and they learned about us,” said Boukhari. 
More from WWD 
Molteni&C Celebrates 90 Years in Milan 
Hall Haus was in Milan this week as part of the group brought by the Arts and Creative Industries at the Royal Commission for the ancient city of Alula to exhibit prototypes from the inaugural Alula Design Residency. 
Bridging the divide between international trailblazers and Saudi manufacturing is the bedrock of a larger plan to build new industries within the Saudi Arabian economy. 
Under the curation of architect Ali Ismail Karimi, the work of the residency’s five design practices were on display: Leen Ajlan from Saudi Arabia; Bahraini—Danish, the architectural office with offices in both Bahrain and Denmark; Hall Haus and Studio Leo Orta from France, as well as Studio Raw Material from India. Madrasat Addeera, the Alula-based school set up to safeguard and perpetuate traditional crafts, also showed the designs for Madrasat Addeera Editions, the fruit of the creative dialogue between the local design community in Alula and a range of well-known Saudi and international designers and artisans. 
Hall Haus’ Zakari Boukhari, Sammy Bernoussi, Teddy Sanches and Abdoulaye Niang. 
The design initiatives are a small but significant part of the Saudi government’s strategy to drive the growth and diversification in its economy, working toward several of its Vision 2030’s goals, including increasing the private sector’s contribution to GDP to 65 percent and increasing the contribution of non-oil exports from 16 percent to 50 percent, among other goals. 
It’s unclear how much the Saudi government has invested in the design industry. According to the State of Fashion in Saudi Arabia report for 2023, fashion by comparison contributed 1.4 percent of the nation’s GDP and 230,000 jobs in 2022. 
“We are working alongside local and global arts and design communities to inspire a new generation of creatives to grow our design economy in line with the ambitions of Vision 2030,” said Nora Albadal, executive director of arts and creative industries at the Royal Commission for Alula. A real driving force in a new wave of investment, she explained, was the establishment of the Ministry of Culture’s Architecture and Design Commission in 2018. “Saudi now has a growing number of impactful institutions and organizations that have launched initiatives across the country,” she added, noting that Saudi Arabia already has “a flourishing design sector” that draws from its own heritage of art and craftsmanship. Other initiatives to propel Saudi Arabian potential to the fore included the presentation of the Alula Design Award during the 2023 Paris Design Week. 
Elsewhere at the exhibit, which was a major draw to Milan Design Week here, Argentine artist Cristián Mohaded presented AlWaha, a sculptural divider made with the Al Khous palm-weaving technique, which is one of the oldest artisan practices in the region. Mohaded, who also works internationally as an independent designer in the fields of furniture, lighting, products and installation, said the experience of working with the region’s local artisans was “amazing,” explaining that craftspeople turn the treated palms into endless rolls of tape. “When you work on this kind of project and you start to understand you don’t want to change anything [they do]… you really start to appreciate the transformation of the material.” 
Design Space Alula also commissioned Cloud, the multidisciplinary practice founded by Paul Cournet and Netherlands-based artist Sabine Marcelis, for the scenography of the exhibition.

2024-05-17 15:18:12,bitcoin set for 9.7% weekly gain as soft cpi report boosts rate cut hopes,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to rise 9.7% on a weekly basis as a softer-than-expected retail inflation report earlier in the week fueled rate cut hopes. The world's oldest cryptocurrency caught a bid on Monday as traders awaited the key inflation report slated to come later in the week. BTC rose ~8% and crossed the $66K mark on Wednesday after soft reports on consumer inflation and retail sales bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve could commence interest-rate cuts sooner this year. The cryptocurrency then continued to trade in a narrow range of $64.6K-$66.7K for the rest of the week. ""The market has seen a swift pickup of Bitcoin price to $66K after the CPI data was lower than expected. The market rallied as this is seen as a possible bullish shift,"" -Lucy Hu, senior analyst, Metalpha said. The U.S. Consumer Price Index eased on a monthly basis in April, while the retail sales, flatlined from a month before after downwardly revised increases in the previous two months. ""Global investors should continue paying attention to other macro indicators in the coming months,"" Hu added. ""After CPI data showed that inflation had cooled in April, the market is now attributing greater probability to the Fed easing monetary policy this year. As a result, asset prices across the board rallied, including equities and Bitcoin,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin financial services firm. Notable News Coinbase Global ( COIN ) closed lower on Thursday following a media report that CME Group ( CME ) is planning to start Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) trading in hopes of profiting from the increasing demand from money managers to add exposure to crypto. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) stock rose after MSCI ( MSCI ) said it will add the software-turn-bitcoin-proxy stock to its MSCI World Index as of the close on May 31, 2024. Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ) said trading volumes in April increased for options and declined for equities and crypto compared with trading volumes in March.

2024-05-17 10:58:26,blackrock’s rieder says fed rate cut would tame inflation by tamping down services demand,"BlackRock’s head of global fixed income says the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to cool inflation as that would dampen demand in the services side of the world’s largest economy. With benchmark rates lingering at their highest in more than two decades, affluent Americans are earning the most they have in years from fixed-income investments, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said on Bloomberg’s “Wall Street Week” program . “People who are middle to higher income are now getting a big benefit from these interest rates, and those are the people that spend, on aggregate, on services,” he said. “Because goods prices have come down so much, it's allowing for disposable income to go into services. That's actually buoying prices in services,” Rieder said. The “price of a pair of tennis shoes is what it was 20 years ago. If you go to a tennis match, it's double what it used to be,” he said. Rieder said the Fed holding interest rates high is a “huge benefit” to people 55 years and older who have been saving money. “They're turning around and spending,” he said. Inflation is sticky in health and auto insurance and other services, Rieder said. “They're unresponsive to interest rates and older people, middle to high income, are spending and are keeping that service level inflation at high levels.” Rieder's interview aired after the April inflation report release this week showed some moderation in prices, sending Treasury yields ( US10Y )( US2Y ) lower on ramped-up expectations for the Fed to start cutting rates this year. “The worst fears were allayed,” by the April data, with prices for transportation services and rent coming down “encouraging,” he said.

2024-05-17 09:35:00,"4 stocks to watch on friday: amat, hood and more","U.S. stocks on Friday opened mixed , with markets largely continuing their pullback from a record-breaking session on Wednesday driven by latest consumer inflation data. Here are some stocks to watch on Friday: Shares of Applied Materials ( AMAT ) rose more than 1% in early trade. They had initially dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the largest U.S. semiconductor equipment maker reported FQ2 2024 results. Applied Materials' ( AMAT ) revenue was flat Y/Y. Its Dynamic Random Access Memory business constituted about 32% of FQ2 sales, up from 11% a year ago. Meanwhile, its foundry, logic and other unit comprised about 65% of total revenue, down from 84% a year ago. Applied Materials ( AMAT ) also provided current quarter revenue guidance that came in above estimates. Several Wall Street brokerages boosted their price target on the stock on Friday. See how AMAT performed in charts . Copart ( CPRT ) stock gained marginally after the opening bell. The company, which conducts online vehicle auctions for car sellers, delivered FQ3 2024 profit that came in-line with expectations, while its revenue rose nearly 11% Y/Y to $1.13B. Copart ( CPRT ) top boss Jeff Liaw noted that in the quarter, the company observed a 14% decline in the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, which pointed to a continued fall in vehicle values. ""As anticipated, new and used vehicle prices have decreased somewhat steeply in recent days, while repair costs remain elevated, driving a strong and continued recovery in total loss frequency,"" Liaw said on the earnings conference call . Class A shares of Snowflake ( SNOW ) fell nearly 2% in early trade. The data warehousing company is in talks to acquire Reka AI for more than $1B, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Reka is an artificial intelligence model startup founded by former researchers from Alphabet's ( GOOG )( GOOGL ) DeepMind. Reka last June reportedly raised $50M in a fundraising round that valued it at $300M. That fundraising had also included a contribution from Snowflake's ( SNOW ) venture arm. Class A shares of Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ) advanced more than 4% after the start of regular trading. Bank of America issued a rare double-upgrade on the stock to Buy from Underperform. The brokerage believes that the ""current entry point"" into the cryptocurrency trading platform is much more positive than when it initiated the stock with an Underperform rating back in 2021 after its market debut. BofA now sees rising retail engagement and accelerating organic growth for Robinhood ( HOOD ) and believes the stock is at an attractive valuation following increases in profit.

The world's largest digital token by market cap ( BTC-USD ) jumped 3.7% to $64K at 10:18 a.m. ET. Ether ( ETH-USD ), too, advanced 2% to $2.95K.

April retail sales, meantime, flatlined from a month before after downwardly revised increases in the previous two months. The reports, nonetheless, spurred traders to marginally raise their bets on a July rate cut. The probability of a 25-basis-point cut increased to 28.3% on Wednesday from a 26.4% on Tuesday, according to the CME FedWatch tool . Now, markets are slightly more confident that the first rate cut will take place in September. But one good inflation report may not be enough for the Fed to change its policy direction.

2024-05-14 14:59:06,bitcoin to stay in $55k-$75k range over near-term: galaxy digital's mike novogratz,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) will continue to oscillate in the $55K-$75K trading range for at least the current quarter, contended Michael Novogratz, Founder and CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital Holdings ( OTCPK:BRPHF ). “We are in the consolidation phase in crypto,"" he said on a conference call after Galaxy ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) published its Q1 results on Tuesday. Over the last two quarters, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other crypto prices drove up significantly, amid speculation on January's approval of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, as well as April's halving event. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had topped out at a fresh record high of over $73K in mid-March, and has since been in a downward spiral, as sticky inflation readings prompted markets to push out their rate-cut expectations. The original token changed hands at $61.3K in Tuesday midafternoon trading. ""Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and everything else, Solana ( SOL-USD ), will consolidate. What does that mean? It means probably somewhere between 55 and 75 until the next set of circumstances, the next set of market events brings us higher,"" Novogratz said. He thinks much of the tailwinds that took place in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 potentially will persist through the next quarter ""until A, either the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or B, we get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity, one way or the other, to the crypto regulatory landscape."" Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick said in a recent note that the U.S. fiscal dominance and Donald Trump winning the presidential election both would work in bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) favor. With the strong crypto-price rally earlier in the year, Galaxy ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) posted Q1 net income of $421.7M that more than tripled from a year before. Novogratz noted in the call that crypto adoption in traditional finance is going strong. People are willing to lend us crypto for a long period of time unsecured, that didn’t happen six months ago and it’s happening now,” he said. “Counterparties are growing. Engagement around the space is just at a different level than what it was before.” More on Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin USD, etc. Bitcoin: Recovery Attempt Fails, Summer Doldrums Loom (Technical Analysis) Bitcoin: Future Results, Not Past Performance (Technical Analysis) Bitcoin drifts higher as traders await U.S. inflation data",0.8052766

2024-05-13 11:23:14,bitcoin drifts higher as traders await u.s. inflation data,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) caught a bid on Monday late morning trading as traders get ready for April's inflation data, which is set to potentially shape the outlook for monetary policy. The first-ever cryptocurrency advanced 2.6% to $62.9K at 11:23 a.m. ET, erasing the May 10 selloff . But, since reaching an all-time high of over $73K in mid-March, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been in a downward spiral, partly owing to falling transaction numbers. Ether ( ETH-USD ) edged up 0.7% to $2.95K at the time of writing. Traders are penciling in one to two interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve toward the end of the year. Since March's inflation data, signs of a weakening labor market have bolstered optimism that inflation will, too, soften further. Markets will digest both producer and consumer price gauges this week, with the former arriving Tuesday and the latter on Wednesday. The critical economic reports will give traders a better idea on if/when the Fed might start rate cuts this year. It's no secret that inflation has been sticky so far this year, with a slew of Fed officials calling for higher-for-longer rates. Coinciding with an up day across risk assets, crypto-related stocks posted intraday gains, including MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) +5.4% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ) +0.9% , Galaxy Digital ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) +0.6% , Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) +4.6% , Marathon Digital ( MARA ) +2.7% and Bakkt ( BKKT ) +6% .

In March, the bitcoin miner announced that Morphy would leave Bitfarms once it had found a CEO to replace him. On May 10, 2024, Morphy filed a complaint against the company in the Superior Court of Ontario, claiming damages for breach of contract, wrongful dismissal and aggravated and punitive damages in the amount of US$27M. Bitfarms ( BITF ) contends that the claims are without merit and said it will ""vigorously"" defend itself. Nicolas Bonta, Bitfarms' chairman and co-founder, was appointed interim president and CEO. The company said its CEO executive search is close to complete and that it will name a new CEO in the next several weeks. The company also rescheduled its Q1 results release to Wednesday, May 15, from Monday, May 13. Bitfarms ( BITF ) stock rose 2.3% in Monday premarket trading.

2024-05-11 16:17:00,"bitcoin stands to gain from u.s. fiscal dominance, trump victory: stanchart","There’s growing risk of fiscal dominance in the U.S., with ever-growing debt and deficits likely on an unsustainable path, and that should be good news for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), according to Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick. Donald Trump winning the presidential election would be a boon for digital assets as well, he added. Fiscal dominance is an economic condition that occurs when governments' fiscal actions overshadow the independence of monetary policy. That, in turn, potentially undermines central banks' ability to control inflation as they would be forced to accommodate government spending. Such a scenario would likely have several implications for the Treasury yield curve: The yield spread between the 2 year ( US2Y ) bill and the 10 year ( US10Y ) note widens, in a move that steepens the yield gap; A greater increase in inflation breakevens (a market-based measure of expected inflation derived from the spread between the yield of a nominal bond and an inflation-linked bond of the same maturity) than inflation-adjusted yields; and A higher term premium, the extra return investors require for holding onto longer-dated bonds instead of shorter-term ones. The price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has a strong relationship with each of these three effects, Kenrick wrote in a recent note to clients. “In a scenario of US fiscal dominance, we think BTC would provide a good hedge against de-dollarization and declining confidence in the UST market,” he added. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon, a long-time bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) critic, appears to agree with Kendrick’s fiscal-dominance assessment. He said in a fireside chat last month that the U.S. economy is “booming,” but that’s in large part driven by the government’s outsized spending. The tradeoff with a debt-fueled economy is inflation, he added. In addition to the prospect of the U.S. dollar losing its dominance as the global reserve currency, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) usually fares well relative to traditional financial assets when the banking system is under stress, or when central banks monetize government debt via quantitative easing, the StanChart note pointed out. Heightened geopolitical risk, however, does not bode well for the token. Also, many people make the case that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a good hedge against inflation. The token's overall uptrend may support that popular notion, but there have been quite a few instances in a recent memory in which the price actually fell, or barely reacted, after a hot inflation reading. A Trump election win should also be a positive for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Kendrick contended, through “looser regulation and the approval of U.S. spot ETFs.” While the Biden administration has adopted a more stringent approach towards crypto, Trump has said that he would not crack down on the use of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) or other digital tokens if elected president again. All told, Kendrick reiterated his price targets on bitcoin ( BTC-USD ): $150K by the end of 2024 and $200K by the end of 2025. The average SA analyst thinks BTC is a Buy (1 Strong Buy, 9 Buy, 3 Hold, 1 Sell). In Saturday afternoon trading, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) changed hands at $61.3K, down 13% M/M , up 45% year-to-date and 122% from a year ago. BTC had reached an all-time high of over $73K in March, but has since pulled back as market participants pushed out their rate-cut expectations in the face of sticky inflation data.

2024-05-10 15:16:22,bitcoin falls 3% week on week as price correction continues,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) traded in a narrow range this week, as the price correction in the top cryptocurrency following the halving event continues. The oldest cryptocurrency, started off the week strongly , as it touched $65K, following a broader market upswing fueled by weaker-than-expected jobs data last week, which added momentum to speculation that the Federal Reserve may consider an interest rate cut. However, BTC stuck to the narrow range of $60K- $64K for the rest of the week. ""Bitcoin topped out in mid-March at $73,793 and has pulled back significantly since then,"" said SA analyst, Florian Grummes . Bitcoin ( BTC-USD )and Nasdaq are strongly correlated, hence expect both asset classes to grind lower during the seasonal rather weaker summer months into the typical bottom in September or October, Grummes added. Cryptocurrency trading volume took a breather in April, as it declined for the first time in seven months as rising geopolitical tensions and slower inflows into U.S.-listed spot ETFs weighed over the digital assets market, a CoinDesk report stated. ""The market has seen a slight rebound from the recent correction, indicating a stabilizing sentiment among investors,"" Lucy Hu, senior analyst, Metalpha, said. Inflows into the U.S. spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have slowed, but some traders believe BTC will continue its bull run in the year. ""The bull run will continue and the price of Bitcoin could reach new highs after the halving based on historical patterns. Investors should still practice appropriate hedging tools to manage risks effectively,"" Hu added.

FTX estimated that it owes some $11.2B to its creditors and that it has $14.5B-$16.3B to distribute them. That means it has up to $5.1B more than needed to pay back its bankruptcy victims.

The largest cryptocurrency by market cap ( BTC-USD ) jumped 4% to $61.7K at 3:27 p.m. ET, compared with the $59.1K mark it changed hands at just minutes before the April nonfarms payroll report arrived. The U.S. economy added 175K jobs in April , less than the 243K expected and a slower pace than the 315K notched in March (revised from 303K), according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The latest tally marks the smallest payroll growth of 2024, with the largest being 315K in March. Wage growth also cooled last month, potentially giving the Federal Reserve the confidence to ease rates later this year.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) started the month on a disappointing note, as it fell to its lowest level seen in more than two months, and slid to $56.6K, before the Fed's decision came in on Wednesday. BTC, however, pared its losses on the day and rose back to the $58K mark, after the Fed decided to ease its quantitative tightening by slowing the pace of its balance sheet runoff, and held the rates steady for its sixth consecutive meeting. Chair Jerome Powell also ruled out rate hikes as the next likely move. The cryptocurrency has been steady since then, and stayed near the $58K mark. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price has rebounded after the Federal Reserve tapered its QT program, which will serve to boost liquidity in the markets, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin digital financial services firm, Cory Klippsten said. ""BTC is sitting above $60,000 and large capital allocators haven’t even arrived to the party yet. This, along the Fed returning to more accommodative policies, has investors bullish on Bitcoin’s future prospects,"" Klippsten added. The largest cryptocurrency has also been witnessing a sell-off, while the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ((ETFs)) have seen outflows. Retail investors selling off cryptocurrencies alongside other headwinds is keeping J.P. Morgan cautious toward the market . On Thursday, U.S. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs witnessed its largest daily outflow since last August, as investors pulled $564M from 11 Bitcoin ETFs, the biggest pullout since the ETFs debuted in January. ""BTC-USD has shown a negative reaction following the recent halving event, contrary to historical trends,"" said SA analyst Income Generator, adding he expects BTC's short term trend to be downward, but long-term is more favorable. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has dropped ~9% since the halving event took place on April 20. ""Most of the evidence appears to be centered in the positive direction, and this means that recent declines in BTC-USD could unveil new buying opportunities relatively soon,"" Income Generator added. Another SA analyst, Knox Ridley , also remained optimistic and said, ""Both technical and on-chain analysis support higher levels for Bitcoin, and as long as any further weakness holds $42,750, we view this dip as a buying opportunity.""

This is due to “fiscal excess, debt, war, deglobalization,” he wrote in a BofA “The Flow Show” report. The 30-year U.S. Treasury ( US30Y ) was down 40% during the past four years. The secular bear “is only over once electorates on Main St. (via elections) and Wall St. (via debt ratings, and failed auctions) vote for less fiscal excess,” he said.

Lastly, he said the U.S. dollar, is in a “secular bear market,” especially compared to cryptocurrencies ( BTC-USD ), ( ETH-USD ), ( BNB-USD ) and gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ). “U.S. debt/deficits require weaker FX to attract foreign capital and/or Fed support for Treasury via rate cuts,” he said, adding that the U.S. dollar cyclical bull on U.S. exceptionalism is driven by “exceptionally easy fiscal policy.” More on United States 30-Year Bond Yield: Weekly Forecast, April 19, 2024: Higher For 30 Years?

It traded close to $59,000 on Thursday, much lower than its all-time high above $73,000 in March. “The past two weeks saw significant selling/profit taking with perhaps retail investors playing a bigger role than institutional investors,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Thursday note. Spot bitcoin ETFs logged outflows in April and retail investors appeared to have sold both crypto and equity assets during last month’s trade, the firm said. Panigirtzoglou also said the market is facing a trio of headwinds consisting of elevated positioning, high bitcoin prices compared with gold as well as estimated bitcoin production costs, and subdued crypto funding by venture capitalists. “In all, with a lack of positive catalysts, with the retail impulse dissipating and with the three headwinds mentioned … still in place, we maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets over the near term,” Panigirtzoglou said. In terms of institutional investors, J.P.

""Investors should understand that the stock is extremely volatile, but as the crypto-economy expands its reach, I expect crypto assets to become less volatile over time,"" said SA analyst KM Capital . KM Capital also said COIN looks like the company of the future. Last month, Coinbase ( COIN ) said it had filed an appeal in a federal court challenging a key legal point that allowed its case against the U.S. SEC to move forward in March. In a so-called interlocutory appeal, the cryptocurrency exchange asked the court to weigh in on whether the SEC can consider a digital asset transaction as an investment contract, a resolution that would have industry-wide implications. Coinbase ( COIN ), which had reaped benefits during the bull market in 2021, had to contend with challenges in 2022 due to certain external factors, said SA analyst Joseph Parrish. ""Despite the setbacks, Coinbase has managed to flesh out the business and continues to evolve under management's vision,"" Parrish added. Last quarter, COIN returned to profitability for the first time in three years, thanks in part to higher interest income from its stablecoin reserves amid a bull run across crypto assets prices. The upside is potentially huge, but it's also a steep climb that depends on outside forces working out well, Parrish said. ""The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC presents a significant opportunity for Coinbase to generate revenue and expand its market share,"" said SA analyst Noah's Arc Capital Management . Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 0 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 13 upward revisions and 0 downward.

2024-05-01 09:33:15,riot platforms q1 earnings buoyed by higher bitcoin prices,"Riot Platforms ( NASDAQ: RIOT ) achieved record quarterly earnings in Q1 2024 as the benefit of higher bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices helped to offset lower bitcoin production and higher mining costs. Q1 EPS of $0.82 , which may not be comparable to the -$0.21 consensus, jumped from -$0.28 in the previous quarter and $0.11 a year ago. Total revenue of $79.3M, falling short of the $95.5M average analyst estimate, dropped from $280.7M in Q4 2023 and rose from $73.2M in Q1 2023. The Y/Y increase reflected a 131% jump in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices, partially offset by lower bitcoin production. During the quarter, the miner generated 1,364 bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), a decrease of 36% from the 2,115 bitcoin produced during the three months ended March 31, 2023, due primarily to the significant increase in the bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023. What's more, the average cost to mine bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to $23,034 from $9,438 in the year-earlier period, driven by an 89% increase in global network hash rate. Adjusted EBITDA of $245.7M advanced from $214.0M in Q4 2023 and $81.7M in Q1 of last year. Riot ( RIOT ) earned $5.1M in power curtailment credits during Q1, compared with $3.1M in power curtailment credits earned a year before. Also during the quarter, Riot ( RIOT ) garnered net proceeds of about $345.7M ($353.2M of gross proceeds, net of $7.5M in commissions and expenses) from the sale of 26,169,300 shares of its common stock at a weighted average fair value of $13.50 per share under its at-the-market equity offering program.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao received on Tuesday a prison sentence of four months after admitting guilt to charges tied to enabling money laundering within his crypto exchange. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) extended intraday losses after the news, sliding 5.1% to $59.7K at 3:18 p.m. ET. Sentenced by U.S. District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle federal court, the 47-year-old billionaire's prison sentence was well below the three years that federal prosecutors had sought. The sentencing guidelines recommended a term of 12 to18 months, while CZ's lawyers had requested five months of probation. In November, CZ was said to have pleaded guilty to allegedly violating criminal U.S. anti-money laundering requirements, resolving the U.S. government's years-long probe into Binance. Zhao also stepped down as CEO of his exchange as part of the settlement. In separate litigation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission each sued Binance, accusing it of mishandling customer funds and operating as an unregistered exchange in the U.S. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced last month to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating the large-scale fraud and conspiracy that led to the downfall of his crypto empire. Unlike Bankman-Fried, Zhao was never accused of stealing customer assets.

2024-04-30 12:32:27,microstrategy stock dives as investors weigh steep q1 loss,"Even though bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged nearly 70% in Q1, MicroStrategy turned in a wider-than-expected loss for the three-month period as current accounting rules resulted in a large impairment charge against the value of its bitcoin stash. MSTR dropped 17% in Tuesday afternoon trading, but still remained 70% higher so far this year. The business intelligence company, run by bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) advocate Michael Saylor, did not opt for early adoption of new accounting rules whereby MSTR could recognize any gains in its bitcoin holdings. Instead, it stuck to current requirements and recorded a digital asset impairment loss of $191.6M in Q1, as its bitcoin buying spree continued. However, there were some positives in the report, amid MSTR's transition to a recurring subscription cloud-based revenue model, including 30% annual growth in subscription billings and a 22% Y/Y increase in subscription services revenues. In its Q1 earnings conference call , MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ), the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), highlighted the benefits of accessing capital markets to buy the token as a capital allocation strategy and why its stock warrants a premium to net asset value. ""While the overall market benefited from the increase in Bitcoin price as well, we believe our opportunistic use of leverage and excess cash to acquire Bitcoin, as well as our capital market strategy generated $1.8 billion of incremental shareholder value,"" said President and CEO Phong Le. BTIG analyst Andrew Harte thinks MSTR is a better way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) than alternatives, such as spot bitcoin ETFs, due to: ""1) the company's ability to leverage capital markets to purchase additional bitcoin, 2) cash flow from its BI software business to acquire more bitcoin, 3) derivatives on the stock that provide investors with risk-management opportunities, and 4) ease of access compared to directly purchasing BTC."" ""We have harnessed volatility, and we've also harnessed our unique ability to issue securities such as convertible bonds,"" Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman, said in the call.

2024-04-28 14:21:00,"microstrategy stands to flourish if it implements new accounting rules, analyst says","Adopting new accounting standards could be a game changer for MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Benchmark said in a recent note to clients. Such a move could significantly boost the software company’s earnings, giving it a shot at joining the S&P 500. Since the Michael Saylor-founded company started holding bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on its balance sheet in 2020, it has recorded $2.27B in cumulative impairment losses due to a rule by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) called ASC 350, analyst Mark Palmer noted. As of March 19, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) held 214,246 BTC , which, as of Friday afternoon’s price, was worth $13.6B. Under the rule, firms treat crypto as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trademarks, copyrights and other items that rarely change hands. As a result, companies record their crypto at the historical price they paid and review their holdings every quarter for impairments. Holdings are considered impaired even if the price of a crypto falls temporarily during the reporting period, and values can’t be upwardly revised if the price recovers. Last year, though, the FASB floated new accounting rules that will allow companies to record gains and losses immediately and classify crypto assets as financial assets. The new rules take effect on Jan. 1, 2025, but companies have the option to apply them early. In MicroStrategy’s ( MSTR ) case, the earnings impact “would be massive: the company in its 2023 10-K report estimated that early adoption would increase its 2024 beginning retained earnings balance by ~$3.1bn,” Palmer wrote. MSTR is slated to publish its Q1 2024 results on April 29 after market close. Analysts, on average, expect the company to post an adjusted loss per share of $0.13 vs. EPS of $5.62 in the previous quarter and EPS of $30.59 a year before. MSTR’s notable earnings fluctuations coincide with bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price volatility. Palmer thinks MSTR could record a gain of over $300 per share in Q1, should it opt for early adoption of the fair-value accounting rules. “However, we also believe that the tax implications associated with adoption could cause MSTR to hold off on electing that option,” he added. With MSTR’s shares being highly liquid, its market cap exceeding $18B, and 50% of its outstanding shares available for trading, the company meets nearly all the requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, the note said. Another criterion for the S&P Dow Jones’ index committee to consider a stock for S&P 500 inclusion includes the submission of positive earnings in a company’s most recent quarter. But, as Palmer noted, MSTR has reported losses in 10 of the past 14 quarters. However, early adoption of the new accounting rules suggests MSTR could meet that requirement. “Inclusion in the S&P 500 would position MSTR’s stock valuation to receive an ongoing boost from price-agnostic purchases of its own shares resulting from enormous passive inflows,” the note read.

2024-04-26 15:18:48,bitcoin almost flat a week after halving event,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to marginally rise 0.3% on a weekly basis, as it traded narrowly in the week, after the keenly-awaited halving event took place last Friday. The largest cryptocurrency prices traded in the range of $62K-$67K in the week. BTC fell briefly below $63K on Thursday, as the Q1 GDP came in at an annual rate of 1.6% signalling sticky inflation, which further dented rate cut hopes. BTC however, quickly recovered back to the $63K mark, and held steady throughout the day. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) also remained near $64K today, despite a significant rise in outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of April 25, U.S.-listed ETFs had a daily total net outflows of $217M, according to Market data . The cryptocurrency also held steady after the core PCE price index , the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying inflation, rose in line with consensus in March. “Bitcoin( BTC-USD ) continues to consolidate in the same range it has for the last month after the much-anticipated halving event. There's been a lot of chatter about price implications, but the real story is that Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) programmatic monetary policy marched ahead as scheduled since the day the network started,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of financial service firm, Swan Bitcoin. The start of the week came off the back of the halving event, as Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) went through its fourth halving event last Friday following a quadrennial software update in blockchain, marking a highly anticipated catalyst for BTC. ""Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) annual inflation rate was cut in half, and, in roughly four years it will be cut in half again. No politics were involved, no talk of the current economic backdrop, and no last-second questioning from policymakers. This certainty and predictability stands in stark contrast to the traditional monetary system,” added Klippsten.

The exchange traded fund issuer added that Bitcoin’s core attributes make scarce, liquid, divisible, portable, transferable, and fungible asset. “As the network matures, asset allocators are likely to evaluate seriously bitcoin’s merit as a risk-off asset,” the firm contended.

2024-04-22 10:30:45,hut 8 gets buy rating as benchmark feels good about post-merger outlook,"Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer started coverage of Hut 8 Corp. ( NASDAQ: HUT ) with a Buy rating on Monday as the company's merger with US Bitcoin Corp. that closed last November ""features a diversified business model with multiple revenue streams,"" from self-mining to hosting to high-performance computing. Shares of Hut 8 ( HUT ) climbed 6.9% in Monday morning trading. Do note that the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which HUT has a strong relationship, also gained 2.2% . Palmer thinks HUT's discount to peers will shrink in the future as the company implements its self-mining expansion plans, he wrote in a note. Management, which previously ran USBTC, ""has held off on purchasing new mining rigs to bolster its self-mining hash rate given its expectation that more efficient 3 nanometer rigs will become available in the coming months, followed by even more efficient 2 nanometer rigs."" What's more, he added, the bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner ""has focused on actions aimed at reducing the company’s cost of mining bitcoin and its realized cost of energy and increasing its cash flow."" Palmer's Buy rating diverges from the average sell-side analyst rating of Hold. More on Hut 8 Mining Hut 8 Mining Corp.

2024-04-20 09:03:42,bitcoin halving takes effect bringing a new era for crypto,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) went through its fourth halving event late Friday following a quadrennial software update in blockchain, marking a highly anticipated catalyst for the world’s highest-profile cryptocurrency. With the 840,000th block posted to the Bitcoin blockchain, the so-called mining rewards offered to miners for validating transactions were slashed in half, leading to a significant reduction in newly issued coins. Analytics site Blockchain.com confirmed that the modification went into effect at 8:10 p.m., an event that could cut the Bitcoin miner rewards to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC per mined block. The overall halving process was scheduled to end at 9:40 p.m. Ahead of the event, H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese predicted that halving could be a positive for the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) due to supply-side constraints. However, citing geopolitical tensions and inflationary concerns, he didn’t rule out short-term pressure on mining stocks ( MARA ), ( RIOT ), ( HUT ), ( HIVE ), ( BTBT ), and ( BITF ).

2024-04-19 15:02:20,bitcoin falls 4.4% on weekly basis just ahead of halving event,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to fall 4.4% on a weekly basis, as traders gear up for the much awaited halving event, which is widely expected to take place later on Friday. The quadrennial halving event is when BTC miners’ reward for validating transactions is slashed in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new tokens are created by 50%. “It's pretty simple: fixed supply, new issuance of bitcoin cut in half, demand and utility rising. Buy Bitcoin regularly, hold with a long-term horizon, and you'll probably be happy you did,”said Brady Swenson, cofounder of Swan, a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) financial services company. The world's oldest digital currency stayed under $70K over the past week, and briefly went below the $60K level on Wednesday for the first time since early March. The dip was reportedly due to an increase in volatility leading up to the halving event. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) also briefly fell below $60K on Friday after r eports of Israel launching a retaliatory strike against Iran, but it quickly regained lost ground. Deutsche Bank said the halving event is already partially priced in by the market. ""Looking ahead, we continue to expect prices to stay high due to expectations of future spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETF approvals; future central bank rate cuts; and regulatory changes."" The research firm also expects the geography of crypto mining to shift after BTC's halving, as the lower block reward compresses margins, forcing miners to seek cheaper and reliable forms of energy. ""Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East have caught the attention of crypto miners due to their lower energy costs."" J.P. Morgan said it does not expect a rise in BTC prices post-halving as the event has already been priced in, and projected a potential downside instead.

Though TradeStation's crypto business has secured money transmitter and other types of regulatory licenses in many U.S. states over the last few years, it was slapped with a $1.5M penalty to settle the U.S. Securities and Commission's charges accusing the Florida-based company of failing to register a crypto lending product before offering it to investors. Kraken, too, was charged by the SEC in November 2023 for allegedly commingling customer money with its own while operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.

2024-04-18 14:34:16,bitcoin halving on deck – here’s what to expect,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a little ways away from undergoing a once-every-four-years software update in the blockchain that has historically been hyped as a positive catalyst for the highest-profile cryptocurrency. The quadrennial halving event, due as soon as Friday, occurs when bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners’ reward for validating transactions is slashed in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new tokens are created by 50%. As such, the technical event reduces the supply of new bitcoins entering the market, a move that could drive up the coin’s price should demand remain constant or rise. And, given the fixed supply of 21M bitcoins ( BTC-USD ), the halving event reinforces scarcity by reducing the rate at which new BTCs are introduced into circulation. If history serves as a guide (that is, the halving has preceded big price gains), the event could boost the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to more than $115K, crypto tax-reporting firm CoinLedger said in a study last month. Since there have only been three halvings so far, it should be taken with a grain of salt that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) tends to rise after the event. SA analyst Florian Grummes had warned that BTC typically weakens for about 15 to 45 days immediately before and after the halving. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had already reached a record high of $73.8K in mid-March, as the green light for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has spurred strong and persistent demand for the token. Now, volatility has spiraled amid the countdown to the halving (as well as jitters about higher-for-longer interest rates), with bitcoin dropping some 17% since hitting its record. H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese is in the camp that the halving will prove to be a positive development for the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). But “the supply shock impact could take months to materialize, and we are now cautious on BTC prices over the short term given geopolitical issues in the Middle East and re-accelerating inflation.” He wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC retreat to the low-to-mid $50K range over the near-term, before rebounding and resuming its longer-term bull run. Should that come to fruition, he added, “there could be some short-term pressure on mining stocks ( MARA ) ( RIOT ) ( HUT )( HIVE )( BTBT )( BITF ) if we were to see such drawdown in BTC prices.” Note that miners’ profitability generally suffers after a halving as their miner reward gets cut in half. This fourth halving will lower the reward to 3.125 BTC from the current 6.25. The overall halving process is expected to end in 2140, when the number of bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) in circulation are expected to reach its programmed cap of 21M. There are currently about 19.7M BTC in circulation. Still, publicly-traded miners “are well positioned to take advantage of the new environment, mainly due to greater access to funding and in particular financing,” J.P. Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Thursday note. “This helps them to scale their operations and invest into more efficient equipment.” Deutsche Bank’s Marion Laboure argued that bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price likely won’t see a significant increase post-halving, as the event “is already partially priced in by the market.” The analyst does expect prices to stay high, though, amid expectations of spot ether ( ETH-USD ) ETF approvals, central bank policy easing and regulatory changes.
