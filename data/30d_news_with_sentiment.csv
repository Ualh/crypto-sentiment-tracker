2024-05-03 15:27:28,"bitcoin bounces back after soft jobs report, crossing $60k threshold","Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rebounded Friday after a soft U.S. jobs report alleviated worries about higher-for-longer interest rates. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap ( BTC-USD ) jumped 4% to $61.7K at 3:27 p.m. ET, compared with the $59.1K mark it changed hands at just minutes before the April nonfarms payroll report arrived. The U.S. economy added 175K jobs in April , less than the 243K expected and a slower pace than the 315K notched in March (revised from 303K), according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The latest tally marks the smallest payroll growth of 2024, with the largest being 315K in March. Wage growth also cooled last month, potentially giving the Federal Reserve the confidence to ease rates later this year. Ether ( ETH-USD ), the world's largest altcoin, too, saw buying pressure on the back of the cooler-than-expected jobs data, advancing 2.2% to $3.06K at the time of writing. Note the crypto-price gains coincided with a strong stock-market rally, with all three major U.S. indices rising at least 1%. ""It's intriguing to note that Bitcoin rose by 5% following the NFP miss,"" Althea Spinozzi, head of Fixed Income Strategy at Saxo, said in an X post.

2024-05-03 15:24:23,bitcoin falls 3.2% on a weekly basis as fed keeps interest rate unchanged,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to post a weekly fall of 3.2% , in a week that saw the Federal Reserve strike a surprisingly more dovish tone while leaving rates unchanged. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) started the month on a disappointing note, as it fell to its lowest level seen in more than two months, and slid to $56.6K, before the Fed's decision came in on Wednesday. BTC, however, pared its losses on the day and rose back to the $58K mark, after the Fed decided to ease its quantitative tightening by slowing the pace of its balance sheet runoff, and held the rates steady for its sixth consecutive meeting. Chair Jerome Powell also ruled out rate hikes as the next likely move. The cryptocurrency has been steady since then, and stayed near the $58K mark. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price has rebounded after the Federal Reserve tapered its QT program, which will serve to boost liquidity in the markets, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin digital financial services firm, Cory Klippsten said. ""BTC is sitting above $60,000 and large capital allocators haven’t even arrived to the party yet. This, along the Fed returning to more accommodative policies, has investors bullish on Bitcoin’s future prospects,"" Klippsten added. The largest cryptocurrency has also been witnessing a sell-off, while the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ((ETFs)) have seen outflows. Retail investors selling off cryptocurrencies alongside other headwinds is keeping J.P. Morgan cautious toward the market . On Thursday, U.S. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs witnessed its largest daily outflow since last August, as investors pulled $564M from 11 Bitcoin ETFs, the biggest pullout since the ETFs debuted in January. ""BTC-USD has shown a negative reaction following the recent halving event, contrary to historical trends,"" said SA analyst Income Generator, adding he expects BTC's short term trend to be downward, but long-term is more favorable. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has dropped ~9% since the halving event took place on April 20. ""Most of the evidence appears to be centered in the positive direction, and this means that recent declines in BTC-USD could unveil new buying opportunities relatively soon,"" Income Generator added. Another SA analyst, Knox Ridley , also remained optimistic and said, ""Both technical and on-chain analysis support higher levels for Bitcoin, and as long as any further weakness holds $42,750, we view this dip as a buying opportunity.""

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao received a prison sentence of four months after admitting guilt to charges tied to enabling money laundering within his crypto exchange.

2024-05-03 10:23:16,"bonds are in an early secular bear market, stocks in a late secular bull market - analyst","BofA Strategist Michael Hartnett said that bonds are in an “early secular bear market” that is driven by inflation. This is due to “fiscal excess, debt, war, deglobalization,” he wrote in a BofA “The Flow Show” report. The 30-year U.S. Treasury ( US30Y ) was down 40% during the past four years. The secular bear “is only over once electorates on Main St. (via elections) and Wall St. (via debt ratings, and failed auctions) vote for less fiscal excess,” he said.

( GLD ) ( USO ) ( PDBC ) Stocks, on the other hand, are “in late secular bull market” with no change in U.S. leadership -- namely, top tech stocks -- since 2019, and no recession to change leadership plus valuation, Hartnett said. ( SPY ) ( IVV ) ( VOO ) ( IWM ) ( IWR ) ( MDY ) According to him, this would end with a bubble and/or with a recession. Lastly, he said the U.S. dollar, is in a “secular bear market,” especially compared to cryptocurrencies ( BTC-USD ), ( ETH-USD ), ( BNB-USD ) and gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ). “U.S. debt/deficits require weaker FX to attract foreign capital and/or Fed support for Treasury via rate cuts,” he said, adding that the U.S. dollar cyclical bull on U.S. exceptionalism is driven by “exceptionally easy fiscal policy.” More on United States 30-Year Bond Yield: Weekly Forecast, April 19, 2024: Higher For 30 Years?

Daily Bitcoin production in April remained the same as the prior month, despite the Bitcoin halving occurring on 19 April 2024.

It traded close to $59,000 on Thursday, much lower than its all-time high above $73,000 in March. “The past two weeks saw significant selling/profit taking with perhaps retail investors playing a bigger role than institutional investors,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Thursday note. Spot bitcoin ETFs logged outflows in April and retail investors appeared to have sold both crypto and equity assets during last month’s trade, the firm said. Panigirtzoglou also said the market is facing a trio of headwinds consisting of elevated positioning, high bitcoin prices compared with gold as well as estimated bitcoin production costs, and subdued crypto funding by venture capitalists. “In all, with a lack of positive catalysts, with the retail impulse dissipating and with the three headwinds mentioned … still in place, we maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets over the near term,” Panigirtzoglou said. In terms of institutional investors, J.P. Morgan said it’s mostly momentum traders such as Commodity Trading Advisors or other quantitative funds taking profit on previous extreme long positions in bitcoin as well as in gold.

The largest digital token by market cap ( BTC-USD ) dropped to as low as $56.6K, before paring losses to $58.6K at 2:49 p.m. ET.

Ether ( ETH-USD ), too, suffered a slump early in the session, but has since crept up to positive territory. At the time of writing, ETH edged up 0.8% to $2.99K. Some of the intraday relief came after the U.S. central bank held rates steady for a sixth straight meeting, as widely expected, and decided to ease its quantitative tightening by slowing the pace of its balance sheet runoff.

The consensus EPS Estimate is $1.05 and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $1.34B (+73.5% Y/Y). ""Bitcoin hit a new all-time high, and Ethereum implemented its largest upgrade in over a year; as such, Coinbase earnings, as a key beneficiary of the activity, will likely to step up significantly this quarter,"" said J.P. Morgan Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices jumped 61% in the first quarter of the year as it benefited from the SEC's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products . The cryptocurrency was boosted by the trading frenzy among the U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. ""The stock has recently bounced back, driven by renewed interest in cryptocurrencies and regulatory approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded funds,"" said SA analyst Yiannis Zourmpanos . ""Investors should understand that the stock is extremely volatile, but as the crypto-economy expands its reach, I expect crypto assets to become less volatile over time,"" said SA analyst KM Capital . KM Capital also said COIN looks like the company of the future. Last month, Coinbase ( COIN ) said it had filed an appeal in a federal court challenging a key legal point that allowed its case against the U.S. SEC to move forward in March. In a so-called interlocutory appeal, the cryptocurrency exchange asked the court to weigh in on whether the SEC can consider a digital asset transaction as an investment contract, a resolution that would have industry-wide implications. Coinbase ( COIN ), which had reaped benefits during the bull market in 2021, had to contend with challenges in 2022 due to certain external factors, said SA analyst Joseph Parrish. ""Despite the setbacks, Coinbase has managed to flesh out the business and continues to evolve under management's vision,"" Parrish added. Last quarter, COIN returned to profitability for the first time in three years, thanks in part to higher interest income from its stablecoin reserves amid a bull run across crypto assets prices. The upside is potentially huge, but it's also a steep climb that depends on outside forces working out well, Parrish said. ""The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC presents a significant opportunity for Coinbase to generate revenue and expand its market share,"" said SA analyst Noah's Arc Capital Management .

Total revenue of $79.3M, falling short of the $95.5M average analyst estimate, dropped from $280.7M in Q4 2023 and rose from $73.2M in Q1 2023. The Y/Y increase reflected a 131% jump in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices, partially offset by lower bitcoin production. During the quarter, the miner generated 1,364 bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), a decrease of 36% from the 2,115 bitcoin produced during the three months ended March 31, 2023, due primarily to the significant increase in the bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA of $245.7M advanced from $214.0M in Q4 2023 and $81.7M in Q1 of last year.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) extended intraday losses after the news, sliding 5.1% to $59.7K at 3:18 p.m. ET. Sentenced by U.S. District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle federal court, the 47-year-old billionaire's prison sentence was well below the three years that federal prosecutors had sought. The sentencing guidelines recommended a term of 12 to18 months, while CZ's lawyers had requested five months of probation. In November, CZ was said to have pleaded guilty to allegedly violating criminal U.S. anti-money laundering requirements, resolving the U.S. government's years-long probe into Binance. Zhao also stepped down as CEO of his exchange as part of the settlement. In separate litigation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission each sued Binance, accusing it of mishandling customer funds and operating as an unregistered exchange in the U.S. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced last month to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating the large-scale fraud and conspiracy that led to the downfall of his crypto empire.

2024-04-30 12:32:27,microstrategy stock dives as investors weigh steep q1 loss,"Even though bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged nearly 70% in Q1, MicroStrategy turned in a wider-than-expected loss for the three-month period as current accounting rules resulted in a large impairment charge against the value of its bitcoin stash. MSTR dropped 17% in Tuesday afternoon trading, but still remained 70% higher so far this year. The business intelligence company, run by bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) advocate Michael Saylor, did not opt for early adoption of new accounting rules whereby MSTR could recognize any gains in its bitcoin holdings. Instead, it stuck to current requirements and recorded a digital asset impairment loss of $191.6M in Q1, as its bitcoin buying spree continued. However, there were some positives in the report, amid MSTR's transition to a recurring subscription cloud-based revenue model, including 30% annual growth in subscription billings and a 22% Y/Y increase in subscription services revenues. In its Q1 earnings conference call , MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ), the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), highlighted the benefits of accessing capital markets to buy the token as a capital allocation strategy and why its stock warrants a premium to net asset value. ""While the overall market benefited from the increase in Bitcoin price as well, we believe our opportunistic use of leverage and excess cash to acquire Bitcoin, as well as our capital market strategy generated $1.8 billion of incremental shareholder value,"" said President and CEO Phong Le. BTIG analyst Andrew Harte thinks MSTR is a better way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) than alternatives, such as spot bitcoin ETFs, due to: ""1) the company's ability to leverage capital markets to purchase additional bitcoin, 2) cash flow from its BI software business to acquire more bitcoin, 3) derivatives on the stock that provide investors with risk-management opportunities, and 4) ease of access compared to directly purchasing BTC."" ""We have harnessed volatility, and we've also harnessed our unique ability to issue securities such as convertible bonds,"" Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman, said in the call.

2024-04-28 14:21:00,"microstrategy stands to flourish if it implements new accounting rules, analyst says","Adopting new accounting standards could be a game changer for MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Benchmark said in a recent note to clients. Such a move could significantly boost the software company’s earnings, giving it a shot at joining the S&P 500. Since the Michael Saylor-founded company started holding bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on its balance sheet in 2020, it has recorded $2.27B in cumulative impairment losses due to a rule by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) called ASC 350, analyst Mark Palmer noted. As of March 19, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) held 214,246 BTC , which, as of Friday afternoon’s price, was worth $13.6B. Under the rule, firms treat crypto as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trademarks, copyrights and other items that rarely change hands. As a result, companies record their crypto at the historical price they paid and review their holdings every quarter for impairments. Holdings are considered impaired even if the price of a crypto falls temporarily during the reporting period, and values can’t be upwardly revised if the price recovers. Last year, though, the FASB floated new accounting rules that will allow companies to record gains and losses immediately and classify crypto assets as financial assets. The new rules take effect on Jan. 1, 2025, but companies have the option to apply them early. In MicroStrategy’s ( MSTR ) case, the earnings impact “would be massive: the company in its 2023 10-K report estimated that early adoption would increase its 2024 beginning retained earnings balance by ~$3.1bn,” Palmer wrote. MSTR is slated to publish its Q1 2024 results on April 29 after market close. Analysts, on average, expect the company to post an adjusted loss per share of $0.13 vs. EPS of $5.62 in the previous quarter and EPS of $30.59 a year before. MSTR’s notable earnings fluctuations coincide with bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price volatility. Palmer thinks MSTR could record a gain of over $300 per share in Q1, should it opt for early adoption of the fair-value accounting rules. “However, we also believe that the tax implications associated with adoption could cause MSTR to hold off on electing that option,” he added. With MSTR’s shares being highly liquid, its market cap exceeding $18B, and 50% of its outstanding shares available for trading, the company meets nearly all the requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, the note said. Another criterion for the S&P Dow Jones’ index committee to consider a stock for S&P 500 inclusion includes the submission of positive earnings in a company’s most recent quarter. But, as Palmer noted, MSTR has reported losses in 10 of the past 14 quarters.

2024-04-26 15:18:48,bitcoin almost flat a week after halving event,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to marginally rise 0.3% on a weekly basis, as it traded narrowly in the week, after the keenly-awaited halving event took place last Friday. The largest cryptocurrency prices traded in the range of $62K-$67K in the week. BTC fell briefly below $63K on Thursday, as the Q1 GDP came in at an annual rate of 1.6% signalling sticky inflation, which further dented rate cut hopes. BTC however, quickly recovered back to the $63K mark, and held steady throughout the day. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) also remained near $64K today, despite a significant rise in outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of April 25, U.S.-listed ETFs had a daily total net outflows of $217M, according to Market data . The cryptocurrency also held steady after the core PCE price index , the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying inflation, rose in line with consensus in March. “Bitcoin( BTC-USD ) continues to consolidate in the same range it has for the last month after the much-anticipated halving event. There's been a lot of chatter about price implications, but the real story is that Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) programmatic monetary policy marched ahead as scheduled since the day the network started,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of financial service firm, Swan Bitcoin. The start of the week came off the back of the halving event, as Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) went through its fourth halving event last Friday following a quadrennial software update in blockchain, marking a highly anticipated catalyst for BTC. ""Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) annual inflation rate was cut in half, and, in roughly four years it will be cut in half again. No politics were involved, no talk of the current economic backdrop, and no last-second questioning from policymakers. This certainty and predictability stands in stark contrast to the traditional monetary system,” added Klippsten.

The exchange traded fund issuer added that Bitcoin’s core attributes make scarce, liquid, divisible, portable, transferable, and fungible asset. “As the network matures, asset allocators are likely to evaluate seriously bitcoin’s merit as a risk-off asset,” the firm contended.

2024-04-20 09:03:42,bitcoin halving takes effect bringing a new era for crypto,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) went through its fourth halving event late Friday following a quadrennial software update in blockchain, marking a highly anticipated catalyst for the world’s highest-profile cryptocurrency. With the 840,000th block posted to the Bitcoin blockchain, the so-called mining rewards offered to miners for validating transactions were slashed in half, leading to a significant reduction in newly issued coins. Analytics site Blockchain.com confirmed that the modification went into effect at 8:10 p.m., an event that could cut the Bitcoin miner rewards to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC per mined block. The overall halving process was scheduled to end at 9:40 p.m. Ahead of the event, H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese predicted that halving could be a positive for the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) due to supply-side constraints. However, citing geopolitical tensions and inflationary concerns, he didn’t rule out short-term pressure on mining stocks ( MARA ), ( RIOT ), ( HUT ), ( HIVE ), ( BTBT ), and ( BITF ).

2024-04-19 15:02:20,bitcoin falls 4.4% on weekly basis just ahead of halving event,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to fall 4.4% on a weekly basis, as traders gear up for the much awaited halving event, which is widely expected to take place later on Friday. The quadrennial halving event is when BTC miners’ reward for validating transactions is slashed in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new tokens are created by 50%. “It's pretty simple: fixed supply, new issuance of bitcoin cut in half, demand and utility rising. Buy Bitcoin regularly, hold with a long-term horizon, and you'll probably be happy you did,”said Brady Swenson, cofounder of Swan, a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) financial services company. The world's oldest digital currency stayed under $70K over the past week, and briefly went below the $60K level on Wednesday for the first time since early March. The dip was reportedly due to an increase in volatility leading up to the halving event. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) also briefly fell below $60K on Friday after r eports of Israel launching a retaliatory strike against Iran, but it quickly regained lost ground. Deutsche Bank said the halving event is already partially priced in by the market. ""Looking ahead, we continue to expect prices to stay high due to expectations of future spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETF approvals; future central bank rate cuts; and regulatory changes."" The research firm also expects the geography of crypto mining to shift after BTC's halving, as the lower block reward compresses margins, forcing miners to seek cheaper and reliable forms of energy. ""Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East have caught the attention of crypto miners due to their lower energy costs."" J.P. Morgan said it does not expect a rise in BTC prices post-halving as the event has already been priced in, and projected a potential downside instead.

2024-04-18 14:34:16,bitcoin halving on deck – here’s what to expect,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a little ways away from undergoing a once-every-four-years software update in the blockchain that has historically been hyped as a positive catalyst for the highest-profile cryptocurrency. The quadrennial halving event, due as soon as Friday, occurs when bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners’ reward for validating transactions is slashed in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new tokens are created by 50%. As such, the technical event reduces the supply of new bitcoins entering the market, a move that could drive up the coin’s price should demand remain constant or rise. And, given the fixed supply of 21M bitcoins ( BTC-USD ), the halving event reinforces scarcity by reducing the rate at which new BTCs are introduced into circulation. If history serves as a guide (that is, the halving has preceded big price gains), the event could boost the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to more than $115K, crypto tax-reporting firm CoinLedger said in a study last month. Since there have only been three halvings so far, it should be taken with a grain of salt that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) tends to rise after the event. SA analyst Florian Grummes had warned that BTC typically weakens for about 15 to 45 days immediately before and after the halving. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had already reached a record high of $73.8K in mid-March, as the green light for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has spurred strong and persistent demand for the token. Now, volatility has spiraled amid the countdown to the halving (as well as jitters about higher-for-longer interest rates), with bitcoin dropping some 17% since hitting its record. H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese is in the camp that the halving will prove to be a positive development for the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). But “the supply shock impact could take months to materialize, and we are now cautious on BTC prices over the short term given geopolitical issues in the Middle East and re-accelerating inflation.” He wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC retreat to the low-to-mid $50K range over the near-term, before rebounding and resuming its longer-term bull run. Should that come to fruition, he added, “there could be some short-term pressure on mining stocks ( MARA ) ( RIOT ) ( HUT )( HIVE )( BTBT )( BITF ) if we were to see such drawdown in BTC prices.” Note that miners’ profitability generally suffers after a halving as their miner reward gets cut in half. This fourth halving will lower the reward to 3.125 BTC from the current 6.25. The overall halving process is expected to end in 2140, when the number of bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) in circulation are expected to reach its programmed cap of 21M. There are currently about 19.7M BTC in circulation. Still, publicly-traded miners “are well positioned to take advantage of the new environment, mainly due to greater access to funding and in particular financing,” J.P. Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Thursday note. “This helps them to scale their operations and invest into more efficient equipment.” Deutsche Bank’s Marion Laboure argued that bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price likely won’t see a significant increase post-halving, as the event “is already partially priced in by the market.” The analyst does expect prices to stay high, though, amid expectations of spot ether ( ETH-USD ) ETF approvals, central bank policy easing and regulatory changes.

2024-04-15 10:25:00,bitdeer rated new buy as it's well positioned to weather post-halving storm,"Needham started coverage of Bitdeer Technologies ( NASDAQ: BTDR ) stock with a Buy rating on Monday as analyst John Todaro thinks the company is well positioned to weather the negative effects of the bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) halving event, citing diversification benefits. ""No revenue vertical has more than 40% share,"" Todaro wrote in a note, which ""will help buffer industry-wide declines in self-mining revenue post the '24 halving as well as during bear markets when BTC prices decline."" He added that, after the halving, Bitdeer ( BTDR ) will have favorable bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) production costs, estimated at about $38K. What's more, ""we expect the stock's discount to peers on both EV/EBITDA and EV/hash rate basis will be eliminated as the company grows its hash rate, improves machine efficiency with new in-house rigs, and increases its presence in US capital markets by shifting its corporate focus from Asia."" Todaro's Buy rating diverges from the SA Quant system rating of Hold and aligns with the average Wall Street analyst rating of Strong Buy. Even with the upbeat coverage, BTDR dipped 4.8% in Monday morning trading.

2024-04-13 13:48:42,coinbase appeals key point in sec lawsuit,"Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) announced late Friday that it has filed an appeal in a federal court challenging a key legal point that allowed its case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to move forward last month. In a so-called interlocutory appeal, the cryptocurrency exchange asked the court to weigh in on whether the SEC can consider a digital asset transaction as an investment contract, a resolution that would have industry-wide implications. This uncertainty has been a major overhang for businesses like Coinbase ( COIN ) and has impacted the overall growth of the digital asset industry. If granted, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit will review a major legal argument that the SEC made to convince a U.S. District Court judge in New York last month to throw out the company’s case before trial. “Coinbase will continue to push for clarity for the entire industry and the 52 million Americans who own digital assets,” Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase ( COIN ) Paul Grewal wrote in an X post late Friday.

2024-04-12 15:07:29,bitcoin falls 1.7% week over week amid heightened market volatility,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to fall marginally by ~1.7% on a weekly basis, amid a sell-off in Wall Street’s major market averages and as volatility levels spiked to their record high of the year. On Friday afternoon, the VIX- known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was up 22.3% . This jump took the volatility index to its highest level since Oct. 31, 2023. The index is now up about 58% from its 52-week low of $11.81 reached in December. The leading cryptocurrency started the week strongly and hit $72K on Monday, a week after it had touched around the $65,000 level. But, BTC retreated below the psychological threshold of $70K on Tuesday over continuing market volatility. BTC prices, however, remained relatively stable on Wednesday and were back to the $70K mark, amid a hotter than expected consumer price index for March, which sent shockwaves across the more traditional markets. ""Although this week has seen a lot of volatility stemming from the US inflation reports and the announcement that the SEC plans to sue Uniswap, the markets have held steady with Bitcoin hovering around $70k,"" said Nick Ruck, COO of ContentFi Labs. ""This could be a sign that the market has not yet peaked and investors are bullish that the industry still has more room to grow,"" added Ruck. Uniswap Labs received a notice from the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating that the SEC plans to recommend a legal action against the company, the firm said in a blog post on Wednesday. Cryptocurrencies are expected to be in the spotlight for some time due to the halving event, which is soon approaching. ""Digital asset investors and traders are asking the question ‘is the halving priced in’ and each cycle it tends to not be. Similarly, many investors thought the BTC ETF approval was also priced in, but over the first 60 days of ETF trading bitcoin price rallied considerably. Why? Because these particular events lead to real changes in supply and demand mechanics on exchange order books,"" said BitGo.

Hong Kong is set to greenlight next week the first round of applications for spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded funds.

The 32-year-old former crypto mogul was convicted in November 2023 on seven different charges , including defrauding FTX customers and creditors. Bankman-Fried's FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2022, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate subsequently was arrested in the Bahamas.

2024-04-11 10:37:45,bullish sentiment continues to decline as inflation stays hot,"Optimism among individual investors about the short-term outlook for the stock market has declined for the second consecutive week as sticky inflation narrows chances of interest rate cuts. A total of 43.4% of respondents of the American Association of Individual Investors, or AAII, Sentiment survey showed optimism about where the market is headed in the next six months, compared to 47.3% and 50%, respectively in the last two weeks. The percentage of those surveyed who felt bearish about the market also rose this week. It came in at 24%, compared to the 22.2% figure last week. Neutral sentiments also rose this week, with 32.5% of the respondents polled by AAII seeing no change in the market direction. The number was 30.5% the week before. The hotter-than-expected consumer inflation report released this week, which climbed 0.4% in March and exceeded the 0.3% rise that economists expected, dampened hopes of a near-term prospect for a Federal Reserve rate cuts. “Even without a war or any other event that causes a major disruption in global oil supplies, we see no scenario for U.S. inflation in which it is likely that the U.S. Fed would be justified in lowering interest rates, any time between now and October 2024,” pointed out Seeking Alpha analyst James Kostohryz. However, President Joe Biden still sees the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by the end of the year, he said on Wednesday, standing by his prediction laid out last month.

The stock's 44% year-to-date climb appears to be largely due to rising bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices (up ~64%) even though crypto only accounts for an estimated 13% of Q1 2024 revenue, analyst Christopher Allen said. ""Given the increase in stock price, we believe valuation levels have disconnected from the fundamental outlook,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Robinhood's ( HOOD ) fundamentals, such as trading activity, assets under custody, and deposit growth, have improved in recent periods, he added, allowing Citi to increase its price target on the stock to $16 from $13. ""But we see risks to the stock here on any material pullback in BTC prices (ETF flows have slowed lately, halving event ahead creates some uncertainty), slower retail activity, or market pullback given current valuations,"" Allen said.

2024-04-08 14:58:34,ripple ceo sees crypto market cap soaring to $5t by year's end - report,"The market value of crypto could nearly double to $5T by the end of the year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said Monday, thanks to persistent demand in recently approved spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded funds as well as the upcoming bitcoin halving event. The overall crypto market cap stood at $2.7T at the time of writing, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Almost three-quarters of that figure represents the combined market value of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). Both tokens have shot up so far this year, with BTC surging 63% YTD, currently inches away from its all-time high reached last month. “I’ve been around this industry for a long time, and I’ve seen these trends come and go,” Garlinghouse told CNBC in an interview. “I’m very optimistic. I think the macro trends, the big-picture things like the ETFs, they’re driving for the first time real institutional money.” The halving, due later this month, ultimately reduces the supply of new bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) entering the market, a move that could drive up the coin’s price should demand remain constant or rise. This will be the first halving in which institutions and retail investors have access to U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, approved on Jan. 10, to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to invest directly in the underlying asset. “That doesn’t take an economics major to tell you what happens when supply contracts and demand expands.” Garlinghouse said , as quoted by CNBC. Also stoking the crypto market this year, the Ripple boss said he is optimistic that crypto regulation in the U.S. will become clearer and more accommodating. “The U.S. is still the largest economy in the world, and it’s unfortunately been one of the more hostile crypto markets.

2024-04-08 06:48:03,crypto market heats up ahead of halving event: bitcoin surpasses $72k again,"The rise of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) over the past year stands at a remarkable 157% and nearly 63% so far this year. The leading cryptocurrency reached above $72,000 on Monday; just after a week, it had touched around the $65,000 level. Bitcoin is currently changing hands at about $72,140, with market capitalization rising to about $1.42 trillion. Cryptocurrencies are expected to be in the spotlight for some time due to the halving event, which is soon approaching. After every four years, new token issuance goes down by half during this event. Previously, halving events were associated with bitcoin price gains. Positive momentum isn’t limited to Bitcoin alone; other digital tokens also recorded significant gains. Ether ( ETH-USD ) increased by 6.4% to $3,608, while Cardano ( ADA-USD ) rose 2.44% and Solana ( SOL-USD ) rose by 1%. Even smaller tokens referred to as meme coins registered gains too; Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) jumped up by almost 5%, and Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ) gained around 3.2%. The spike in bitcoin's price has also had an impact on crypto-related stocks. Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) rose by 5%, Riot Blockchain ( NASDAQ: RIOT ) climbed 5.9%, Marathon Digital Holdings ( NASDAQ: MARA ) was up 7.6%, Hut 8 Mining ( NASDAQ: HUT ) gained 5.8%, CleanSpark ( NASDAQ: CLSK ) jumped by 7.4%, MicroStrategy Incorporated ( NASDAQ: MSTR ) surged 12.2%, Cipher Mining ( NASDAQ: CIFR ) saw an 8% increase, Stronghold Digital Mining ( NASDAQ: SDIG ) rose by 2.3%, Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company ( NASDAQ: BTDR ) climbed 3.4%, and Bakkt Holdings ( NYSE: BKKT ) rose 6%.

2024-04-05 15:06:24,"bitcoin off to a slow start in q2, falls 2.6% week-on-week","Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) started this month on a weaker note after last month's rally, with the top cryptocurrency set to fall ~2.6% this week. As for the halving event expected in a little over two weeks, some believe current prices may have already factored in the event, while others argue there may still be some upside ahead. ""After hitting and breaking the resistance zone coming from the two major peaks in 2021, BTC stalled and started moving sideways but did not break back below the former resistance level, which is now acting as support. So that is an indication that the market feels quite comfortable here,"" said Julius de Kempenaer, Senior Technical Analyst at StockCharts.com. Kempenaer expects an upward break and a further rally in the next week or two. BTC started the week strongly, as it touched $70K on Monday, but dropped significantly below the mark on Tuesday , after the U.S. manufacturing activity came in hotter than expected. BTC, however, caught a bid on Thursday, on a day when the U.S. stocks closed lower, after some Federal Reserve speakers issued cautious commentary on rate cuts, adding more evidence is needed before interest rate cuts are implemented. ""Historically, BTC halving events have marked significant points followed by 9-18 months of uptrend, culminating in cycle peaks. However, for the first time, BTC reached its all-time high in anticipation of the halving, indicating a departure from previous cycles,"" said Matteo Greco, research analyst at Fineqia International. ""If historical patterns repeat, we may witness an uptrend for the remaining nine months of 2024, leading to a cycle peak expected between Q4 2024 and Q2 2025,"" Greco added.

This is not Amazon in 1994. This is Amazon in 2004.

The survey results came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday repeated the need for more evidence before cutting rates, indicating that a slight possibility of rate cuts later this year. Powell said he doesn't expect ""that it will be appropriate"" to lower the policy rate until ""we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2%."" This has led to Wall Street’s main stock indexes gain on Thursday. However, a recent Seeking Alpha analysis by Michael Kramer pointed out that “rising commodity prices and warning signs indicate that inflation readings in the coming months may not be favorable, reducing the likelihood of rate cuts in 2024.” Separately, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that U.S. services growth slowed in March, with PMI falling to 51.4 versus 52.6 in February.

2024-04-03 14:56:37,the us economy will continue to decarbonize even if trump is elected," Bank of America 
CF Industries’ Donaldsonville Ammonia Production Facility Has Invested in Carbon Capture 
Myron Ebell, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transition team for Trump’s first term, says that should Donald Trump and the Republicans defeat President Biden in November’s election, they will seek to dismantle climate legislation. A core target will be the Inflation Reduction Act, the legislation filled with support for clean energy projects and electric vehicles. If you read news coverage and the statements of both prominent Republicans and Democrats, this is a common point of view. 
Andrew Obin, a managing director for equity research, begs to differ. He believes the US economy will continue to decarbonize no matter who is elected in November. In February, Mr. Obin spoke at ARC Advisory Group’s Industry Leadership Forum in Orlando. A central theme of the conference was energy transition and industrial sustainability. 
One reason for this is that public companies care about these issues. They must. According to Bank of America research, climate is the top reason why shareholders vote for proxies. A proxy allows an investor to vote without being physically present at the annual shareholder’s meeting. Shareholders are giving their proxies to parties they do care deeply about climate issues. 
BofA global equity research also suggests that US public companies will spend an extra $2.4 trillion over the next five years over what they were previously going to invest to meet net-zero targets. The energy sector will invest the most. It is projected to spend nearly $500 billion in extra capex during this time period. 
Industrial policy is part of the reason for these surges in investment. Before the Inflation Reduction Act and other pieces of legislation were passed, the US spent 0.4% of its GDP on industrial policy. It is now up to 0.8%, the highest among all Western economies. This stimulus peaks in 2026, but it will continue through 2031. 
Further, while the new legislation creates roughly $400 billion in subsidies, it creates $1 trillion in tax incentives! 
In the Energy sector, net zero can not be achieved without carbon capture and storage. The Inflation Reduction Act creates carbon capture tax credits that are worth $85 per ton of captured carbon. For CF Industries’ Donaldsonville Ammonia Production facility, these credits mean that a $200 million investment in carbon capture will lead to $100 million in benefits per year and those benefits will continue for several years. 
In short, the subsidies and tax credits create real opportunities for some of the industries most responsible for the increase in carbon in the atmosphere. 
However, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed without a single Republican vote in 2022. If Trump’s election also leads to a Republican majority in Congress, what will stop Congress from dismantling this bill? 
Jobs in the energy sector are primarily in the red states. The new carbon capture plants will create construction jobs, which will also be primarily in red states. It is one thing for Republicans to vote against the Inflation Reduction Act. It is quite another for these representatives to take jobs and investments out of their constituencies. “This legislation was cleverly designed,” Mr. Obin said. Many of the red state benefits are designed to be sticky. Republicans will not be able to kill tax subsidies.”",0.16298696

The San Francisco non-profit, HomeRise, is one of the city’s largest housing
providers for formerly unhoused people. They have an annual budget of $34
million dollars, managing more than 1500 units across 19 properties.

HomeRise develops affordable housing for formerly unhoused individuals and
families; this includes constructing new buildings, and fixing or leasing
existing ones. At those properties they provide a number of services, including
maintenance, janitorial, and other supportive services.

Over the last couple years, they’ve received more than $200 million in loans,
subsidies, and grants from the city. But concerns about their spending started
as early as 2021. That’s when the City’s Department of Homelessness and
Supportive Housing, or HSH, noticed discrepancies and ineligible expenses in
their January 2021 invoicing.

HSH and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development say they met
with HomeRise in 2021 and 2022. But the nonprofit was unable to fix the issues
the city raised at those meetings. The city ultimately requested the city
controller audit the non-profit.

The audit, which was released on Tuesday, covered calendar years 2019 to 2022,
and part of 2023. It focused only on financial matters, and did not investigate
the non-profits’ supportive services, or its facilities and maintenance
management.

The audit found more than $200,000 in unplanned and unbudgeted staff bonuses,
and millions of dollars of unexplained spending, among dozens of other issues.

HomeRise hired new executives in 2023, who say they have implemented new
policies and procedures to address these issues. But the city was unable to
confirm these claims.

HomeRise operates nearly a third of city-funded units that serve formerly
unhoused people.

2024-04-04 05:00:00,china’s stagnating economy has forced xi jinping into a humiliating global retreat," Xi Jinping’s is taking a more conciliatory approach to relations with Joe Biden’s administration in a bid to ease external pressures - REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque 
After the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in 1989 and the world turned against China, Deng Xiaoping told the Communist Party to “hide your strength and bide your time”. 
That mantra became the doctrine for Chinese foreign policy over the subsequent decades – get on with China’s grand mission of economic reform and radical growth without drawing unnecessary attention. 
But under Xi, there has been little hiding or biding; it was more wolf warriors and making China great again. 
As Deng might have predicted, the West started to see China as a threat, not as a partner. Slowly, Xi seems to be realising that Deng had a point, brought down to earth by China’s slowing economy and an increasingly hostile world. 
Earlier this week, Xi spent nearly two hours on the phone with President Joe Biden, striking a markedly friendlier tone than before. This comes after November’s San Francisco summit, in which Xi promised all sorts of goodies to the US and left analysts wondering what on earth China got in return. 
Things aren’t happy at home. The economy has been in the doldrums since real estate giant Evergrande defaulted spectacularly on its debt in 2021, or perhaps the downturn started during Trump’s trade war before then. 
The extraordinary zero Covid years didn’t help, and the widely-expected post-Covid recovery has barely materialised, with consumer and business confidence at an all-time low. 
Last summer, before the Communist Party stopped publishing the figures, over a fifth of Chinese young people were unemployed. When I was in Shanghai earlier this year, attending a business summit, the only bullish investors (Chinese or international) were those with a stake in electric cars. 
There are, of course, still bright spots in China’s present and future. Renewables is one of them – Chinese EVs are set to take a quarter of European sales this year. 
March data shows that factory activity is recovering, and analysts at Citi have just upgraded their prediction for the economy to 5pc growth this year (Rishi Sunak would kill for half of that). But it’s not quite enough to arrest the concerning slowdown. China may never escape the middle income trap. What will happen to the CCP’s mandate to rule then? 
When I interviewed the then foreign secretary James Cleverly at Conservative Party Conference last year, he told me that China’s slowing growth was bringing it back to the negotiating table. I was sceptical then, but in the months since we’ve seen more evidence that something of the sort really may be happening. 
First, Xi made the remarkable trip to meet Biden in San Francisco, even though Chinese leaders prefer to be on home turf. Now, the two hour phone call, which Chinese state media calls continuing “the San Francisco vision”. 
That vision looks an awful lot like a Chinese retreat to cautiousness in a bid to ease the external pressure on its economy. At San Francisco and in this week’s call, Xi complained about America’s sanctions that threaten to contain China’s progress in semiconductors, AI and renewables; protested against the US’s increasingly loud support for Taiwan; and raised the issue of TikTok, which is currently being threatened with divestment from its parent company (TikTok may not thank Beijing for the intervention). 
In return, the wolf warriors have been leashed, punitive trade barriers rolled back (such as the four-years-long embargo on Australian wine, which ended last week), and the Chinese and American militaries have started talking again. 
Deng’s wisdom was that he didn’t drink the Communist Kool-Aid and saw China’s weaknesses and strengths for what they were. 
He knew that it wasn’t ready to take on the US, that it still had more to gain from western friendship. In return, he saw that the West craved access to China’s gigantic market. Deng’s China wasn’t necessarily a happier or freer place – but he convinced the world it was an inoffensive, well-meaning country on the route to liberalisation, somewhere the West could do business with. 
Xi’s China is many times stronger, and perhaps without the pandemic it’d have soon become the world’s largest economy. But still, the average American is six times as wealthy as the average Chinese person. 
China’s semiconductors are good, but nowhere as good as the Taiwanese and South Korean alternatives; its military is large and growing, but spending is less than a third of the US equivalent. 
Crucially (and too often overlooked by its critics), China is still reliant on trade with the West – its biggest trading partners are the EU, US, and South Korea. That dependence goes both ways. Beijing has revealed its hand too soon, and now the West is trying to contain it. 
Despite China’s entreaties, Biden is not backing down on sanctions on Chinese tech and renewables. Neither would he be able to – politicians and public opinion in the West have turned against China, incensed by the CCP’s bravado. 
Xi will soon find that the reputational damage can’t be fixed quickly.",0.10862543

2024-04-03 10:29:31,u.s. chamber of commerce announces small business owner confidence in the economy ticks up in first quarter of 2024," April 3, 2024 - Washington, D.C. — The Q1 MetLife and U.S. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Index, which measures small business owner confidence, is 62.3—similar to last quarter’s score of 61.3—reflecting a stable business climate. More small businesses see an improving economy, helping to drive the headline score up one point.  
One in three (32%) small business owners now say the U.S. economy is in good health, up seven percentage points from last quarter. Roughly two in five (38%) say their local economy is in good health, up eight percentage points from the end of 2023.   
“Small businesses’ perceptions of the economy are drifting upward, with businesses reporting being comfortable with their cash flow and the health of their business,” said Tom Sullivan, Vice President of Small Business Policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “While many business owners have continued to struggle with high prices and rising wages, recent jobs reports are positive. While headwinds remain, confidence is ticking upward and small businesses are more resilient and prepared for unforeseen challenges.” 
Most small businesses are reporting consistent, high satisfaction with the state of their cash flow and business health. About two-thirds of small businesses say the overall health of their business is good (65%) and that they are comfortable with their current cash flow (67%). 
Overall perception of the economy remains muted: nearly half of small businesses continue to feel the economy is in poor health. Small businesses remain concerned about inflation—this is the seventh consecutive quarter that over half (52%) of small businesses cite inflation as a top challenge. In addition, concern for revenue rose seven percentage points this quarter with 29% saying revenue is a top challenge, returning to a level of concern last recorded in late 2021. 
“It is encouraging to see the majority of small business owners are satisfied with their business’s health and their current cash flow, despite ongoing concerns around inflation,” says Cynthia Smith, SVP, Head of Regional Business at MetLife. “These trends convey a sense of optimism for the future and, once again, underscore the adaptability and determination shown by small business owners in challenging economic environments.” 
Cybersecurity and supply chains are top threats   
This quarter’s survey also asked small businesses about their concern for future threats and crisis planning in response to those threats. Small businesses say they are most concerned about:   
Overall, most (71%) small businesses say they are adequately prepared for future threats. Most (80%) also say they have a clear idea of how to change their business if it starts to struggle—up 13 percentage points from Q4 2020 (67%), but six points under Q2 2018 levels (86%).   
Though these topline numbers indicate most small businesses feel prepared to handle what comes their way, across the board, most say they are only somewhat prepared to deal with them, rather than very prepared.   
For example, 23% say they are very prepared for cybersecurity threats, versus 50% who feel somewhat prepared. The gap is even larger in preparedness for a supply chain breakdown (14% very prepared, 47% somewhat prepared).     
To address a range of potential threats, small businesses are contributing to rainy-day funds (62%), installing surveillance precautions (56%), training staff on cybersecurity measures (48%), establishing formalized plans for future threats (43%), taking out insurance in case of natural disaster (38%), and building out existing supply chains (35%).   
“Fortunately, we don’t worry too much about natural disasters in Chicago, but cybersecurity is another story. We have taken several steps to boost security,” says Philip Preston, president of PolyScience in Niles, Illinois. “This includes daily offsite backup, two factor authentication for remote access, contracting an outside firm to test our cybersecurity monthly, and purchasing cyber insurance.” 
About the Small Business Index

”Indeed, our public debt is not high. Today the Prime Minister spoke about 17% of GDP. I think that, perhaps, by the end of the year it will be even a little lower. We are very careful about this indicator, since servicing costs are also rising amid the growth of interest rates,” the minister said.

Voters and economists seem to have wildly different views of the US economy, a disconnect that’s hurting President Joe Biden in the key states that will decide the 2024 election. 
There’s new polling from The Wall Street Journal that outlines the dichotomy and the challenge it represents for Biden in particular as memories of the Donald Trump years fade. 
Perceptions vs. data 
Swing state voters, according to the Journal, are more focused on the economy and inflation than those nationwide, and they also have a dimmer view of the state of the country. 
Just one-quarter of registered voters in these seven key states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – say the economy has improved in the past two years. The economic data, on the other hand, suggests inflation is cooling and the US seems likely to avoid a recession that seemed likely a year ago. The soft landing happened without even spiking the unemployment rate, which was a real fear. 
“A relatively strong economy” is how Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary, described it last month. For context, Summers was early to raise the alarm about the threat of inflation after the Covid-19 pandemic, and he has loudly criticized the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve for most of Biden’s term. 
The US economy vs. your state economy 
The disconnect runs much deeper than a misalignment of voters’ perceptions and economic indicators. About half of these voters think their own economic situation is fine, and they might rate their individual states as positive. The national economy, however, gets a bad rating. 
From the Journal: 
In North Carolina, for example, voters describe the national economy in negative rather than positive terms by 66% to 33%. Yet those numbers are reversed when asked to rate the state’s economy. In Wisconsin, negative views of the national economy outweigh positive ones by 16 points, while positive views of the state economy outweigh negative ones by 17 points. 
Across these battleground states, 46% of registered voters said their personal financial situation is headed in the right direction. 
Why the disconnect? 
The divide between Americans’ views of their personal finances and their broader economic sentiments isn’t new. CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy pointed me to Gallup polling from last April in which just 16% rated the economy as good or excellent, but 45% said their personal finances were good or excellent. (Perceptions of the economy have improved modestly in the intervening year.) 
Edwards-Levy also noted that partisanship can play a role in even seemingly non-political questions about the state of the nation. 
“People’s answers to surveys are often intended at least partially as an expression of partisan support or opposition,” she said, adding that is “compounded when talking about broad national trends.” 
Many may feel left behind 
It’s also true that while people might say in a survey that their financial situation is fine, there are indications that they also feel unable to keep up. 
Just read CNN’s reporting about tenants who can’t afford to pay their rents, the barriers to home ownership that are compounded on racial minorities or the issue with 401(k) balances. 
Stock markets may have repeatedly set records this year, making people with investments feel flush, but only about a quarter of registered voters across the swing states surveyed by the Journal said the ability for the average person to get ahead is moving in the right direction in the US. 
The ‘once people start to focus’ argument 
Biden’s task with this election cycle will be to convince these voters that their personal and state situation is writ large in the country too. 
As it stands, roughly half or more of registered voters in all of the swing states in the new Wall Street Journal poll say Trump is the candidate best able to handle the key issues of the economy, inflation and immigration. 
Biden’s supporters say the public will come around as the election nears. 
“You know what, once people start to focus in, and they see their two choices, it’s obvious that Joe will win this election,” first lady Jill Biden said on CBS on Wednesday morning. 
She disputed the Journal poll, which shows Trump holding a small lead in Arizona and North Carolina and matchups within the margin of error in the other five states. When potential independent or third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are added to the question, Trump still leads by a narrow margin in Arizona and North Carolina, with no clear leader in the other states. 
“He’s coming up,” Jill Biden said of the president, indicating he would rise in polls. 
It’s certainly true that there’s a lot of campaigning left to do and a lot of time for developments between now and November. 
Will a campaign sell voters on Biden’s economy? 
On Wednesday, the president joined the progressive, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at the White House to brag about Democrats’ efforts to contain prescription drug prices. 
Biden said that by allowing Medicare to negotiate for certain prescription drugs, he and Sanders “beat Big Pharma finally.” Insulin is now capped at $35 for Medicare enrollees, for instance. 
Most voters probably haven’t yet gotten the message about beating Big Pharma. More than half of US adults nationwide said they worry about being able to afford prescription drugs, according to a KFF poll released in February. 
Presidential favorability ages well 
George W. Bush’s favorability rating was an objectively abysmal 35% when he left office in January 2009, according to CNN polling at the time. Nine years later, as Americans lived through the next Republican presidency – Trump’s – Bush’s favorability rating had completely rebounded. With the Iraq War and the Great Recession in the rearview mirror – and with Bush, unlike Trump, out of politics – 61% of Americans had a favorable view of him. 
Trump’s approval rating may have partially rebounded even though he is still very much in the political mix. More than half the country thought Trump should be removed from office after the January 6, 2021, insurrection, according to CNN polling at the time. His approval rating was just 34%. In the years since, as the shock of the attack on the US Capitol has faded and voters came to associate Biden with the White House and the trying years of the pandemic, views of Trump in hindsight have improved. 
Now, more than half of registered voters in the Wall Street Journal poll of battleground states said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the job Trump did as president. That blur of hindsight is a huge advantage for Trump. Just 38% of registered voters in the Journal poll said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the job Biden is doing as president. 
Biden is neck-and-neck with Trump among registered voters in those seven swing states on the question of protecting democracy. That should stun the White House since Biden has made protecting democracy, both in the US and abroad, the central tenet of his entire presidency.",0.052278586

GEC was a British manufacturing titan; a cash-rich producer of everything from washing machines to railway trains.

In the second of their Fallen Angel series, Neil Collins and Jonathan Ford talk to industrial historian Nick Comfort about one of the most abrupt collapses in UK corporate history and its heavy industrial cost.

The documentation failed to include a current financial statement or list an attorney-in-fact and has been returned to the Republican presidential candidate for resubmission. 
On Tuesday, Mr Trump suffered a further legal setback when his efforts to have his upcoming Manhattan hush money trial delayed on presidential immunity grounds were likewise rejected.. 
Judge Juan Merchan ruled that “the defendant had myriad opportunities to raise the claim of presidential immunity” long before he ever did and that, because he was denying the motion on that basis, he need not address whether immunity “precludes the introduction of evidence of purported official presidential acts in a criminal proceeding”. 
Meanwhile, Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith has urged Judge Aileen Cannon, overseeing the classified documents case in Florida, to reject the former president’s contention that he had any claim to personal ownership over the boxes of top secret files reclaimed by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, deriding the argument as “pure fiction”.

Hush money trial: Trump finds new ways to get around extended gag order 
09:30 , Joe Sommerlad 
Trump has found new ways to push the envelope in criticising Judge Juan Merchan’s daughter and other elements of the New York criminal trial he deems “unfair” – even after the gag order was extended in the case. 
On Monday, Judge Merchan expanded the gag order to include family members of the court staff after Trump attacked the judge’s daughter Loren Merchan, who has worked on Democratic campaigns. 
The order now prevents Trump from publicly commenting about witnesses, prosecutors, court staff, jurors and now the family of court staff to prevent any harm to the trial. 
But on social media, the former president has found ways to skirt the order by sharing his opinions in other ways: by re-posting clips of others criticising Ms Merchan and using vague language in his own posts. 
Ariana Baio has more. 
Hush money trial: Judge Merchan denies Trump’s immunity claim

The Manhattan judge presiding over Trump’s upcoming hush money trial has denied his latest bid to have his criminal case delayed on presidential immunity grounds, saying the former president’s filing was “untimely.” 
On Wednesday afternoon, Judge Juan Merchan submitted a six-page filing denying Trump’s last-ditch effort to delay the proceedings, which are due to being on 15 April, after the defendant’s legal team had previously successfully delayed it by 30 days. 
Trump submitted the motion on 7 March, asking Judge Merchan to delay the trial until after the US Supreme Court has ruled on whether the presidential immunity defence applies to criminal charges against sitting or former presidents, a matter it will begin considering on 25 April.

Truth Social: Trump cheers campaign and RNC’s $65.6m March fundraising haul and posts Jan 6 choir video 
08:30 , Joe Sommerlad 
Trump’s election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $65.6m in March, ending the month with $93.1m in cash on hand, Politico reports. 
The total covers a range of fundraising vehicles supporting the former president’s goal of returning to the White House, all of which will have to disclose their activities to the Federal Election Commission later this month. 
Trump’s allies hope it will go some way towards easing concerns that President Joe Biden is way ahead of his Republican rival in terms of fundraising, though no figures have emerged from the Democrats as of yet. 
It is known that the president raised $26m in a single night during a New York City fundraiser attended by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama last week, however. 
In February, the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee raised $53m, ending the month with $155m on hand, whereas Trump raised just $20.3m in February with $40.9m on hand. 
He’s been celebrating the news on Truth Social – and throwing up a Jan 6 choir video for good measure.

A week after Donald Trump’s motion to delay his criminal hush-money trial due to pretrial publicity, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg files opposition—noting this is Trump’s eighth delay request. 
The DAs’ reasons are the same as they brought up in last week’s hearing: it’s unlikely to abate, jury selection can mitigate this, and the former president is making things worse. They also note that there is no new information to consider since the last request to dismiss the case. 
“...despite being asked to identify new information unavailable the last time his request was denied on February 15, 2024, defendant has littered his motion with dozens of untrue allegations based on events that date back three years or more—most of which were already considered and rejected in prior decisions by this Court.”

Donald Trump has promised his Christian followers that election day on 5 November will serve as “Christian Visibility Day”, predicting it will be an occasion “when Christians turn out in numbers that nobody has ever seen before” to vote him back into the White House. 
The Republican presidential contender was speaking at a rally at the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Tuesday evening when he made the remark, an allusion to the spurious outrage among Republicans caused by Trans Visibility Day happening to coincide with Easter Sunday this year. 
Properly known as International Transgender Day of Visibility but often shortened to Trans Visibility Day, the date to recognise members of America’s transgender community was founded by Michigan-based activist Rachel Crandall in 2009 and has taken place on 31 March every year since. 
In 2024, due to a quirk caused by the spring equinox, Easter Sunday fell on the same date.

President Joe Biden’s campaign sees an opening to win over voters in Florida after the state’s supreme court allowed for its abortion ban to go into effect but also allowed for a proposed constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights could be on the ballot. 
On Monday, the court overturned three decades of precedent to uphold a ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which would likely allow for a more restrictive law signed by Governor Ron DeSantis that bans abortion at six weeks to take effect. 
At the same time, the court wrote that a proposed constitutional amendment that would protect Floridians’ right to an abortion until the point of “viability” for a foetus could be on the ballot. 
Mr Biden criticised the decision in a statement from the White House on Tuesday morning.

BREAKING: Hush money judge denies Trump’s bid to delay trial based on presidential immunity 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 21:54 , Oliver O’Connell 
Justice Juan Merchan has denied Donald Trump’s bid to stave off his criminal hush money trial in New York based on presidential immunity. 
He says that the former president’s motion is denied as untimely. 
“The court finds that the defendant has myriad opportunities to raise the claim of presidential immunity well before March 7, 2024” —the date when Trump filed his immunity motion. 
Because Judge Merchan finds that Mr Trump’s motion is denied as untimely, he says that he need not address the question of whether presidential immunity “precludes the introduction of evidence of purported official presidential acts in a criminal proceeding”. 
To clarify, while the former president has argued in other cases that he is shielded from standing trial, the New York motion only claimed that presidential immunity prohibited the use of certain evidence (official communications during his presidency).

Dakota Adams spent many years unlearning the lessons his father taught him. Growing up under the watchful eye of Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the largest far-Right militia in the United States, meant being ready for the government to break down his door at any moment. 
Now, in a development that would no doubt infuriate his imprisoned dad, the 27-year-old is running for office as a Democrat in deep-red Montana. He hopes his experience escaping that conspiracy-filled world might help others break out of their own echo chambers — the kind that has ensured Republican rule there for generations. 
“Not all of it is going to be applicable for talking to the average person who has been the target of decades of misinformation by the likes of Fox News, but I think there is some useful insight to be gleaned from how I worked my way out,” he told The Independent. 
“It gives me, at the very least, an understanding of where these people are coming from.”

Former president Donald Trump has found new ways to push the envelope in criticising Judge Juan Merchan’s daughter and other elements of the New York criminal trial he deems “unfair” – even after the gag order was extended in the case. 
On Monday, Judge Merchan expanded the gag order to include family members of the court staff after Mr Trump attacked the judge’s daughter Loren Merchan, who has worked on Democratic campaigns. 
The order now prevents Mr Trump from publicly commenting about witnesses, prosecutors, court staff, jurors and now the family of court staff to prevent any harm to the trial which is slated to begin 15 April. 
But on social media, the former president has found ways to skirt the order by sharing his opinions in other ways: by re-posting clips of others criticising Ms Merchan and using vague language in his own posts.

New poll has Biden up by two points over Trump 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 20:30 , Oliver O’Connell 
The latest NPR/PBS/Marist poll of national registered voters shows released today has Joe Biden leading Donald Trump by two points, 50 per cent to 48 per cent, if the presidential election was held now. 
Some 60 per cent of registered voters nationally say they know for whom they will vote, and nothing can change their minds. However, about four in ten can be persuaded, including 29 per cent who say they have a good idea for whom they will vote but could still switch to another candidate and 12 per cent who have not made up their minds. 63 per cent of Biden’s supporters, compared with 59 per cent of Trump’s supporters, say their vote is solid. 
In a multi-candidate field, Biden receives 43 per cent to 41 per cent for Trump among registered voters including leaners. Independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr (11 per cent) is the only other candidate with double-digit support. Independent Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 1 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. Independents break 38 per cent for Trump to 33 per cent for Biden and 21 per cent for Kennedy. Independents support both West and Stein at 3 per ncet.

‘Why can’t you do anything normal’ asks Seth Meyers of Trump 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 19:45 , Oliver O’Connell 
Late Night host Seth Meyers ridiculed Donald Trump’s campaign after they opened with the line “just kidding” rather than “April Fools” in a 1 April prank email to their supporters. 
The Trump campaign circulated a joke email to his subscribers on April Fools’ Day with the subject line “I’m suspending my campaign…”, which most likely gave his critics and supporters alike a momentary shock. 
However, the statement was purely a bit of old-fashioned clickbait as when the email body was opened people were met with a big “JUST KIDDING”. 
“Just kid-I think you mean April Fools,” Meyers reacted, “Why can’t you do anything normal?

7 years in prison for megaphone man who led attack on police during Capitol riot 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 19:33 , AP 
A Washington state man who used a megaphone to orchestrate a mob’s attack on police officers guarding the U.S. Capitol was sentenced on Wednesday to more than seven years in prison. 
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said videos captured Taylor James Johnatakis playing a leadership role during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Johnatakis led other rioters on a charge against a police line, “barked commands” over his megaphone and shouted step-by-step directions for overpowering officers, the judge said. 
“In any angry mob, there are leaders and there are followers. Mr. Johnatakis was a leader. He knew what he was doing that day,” the judge said before sentencing him to seven years and three months behind bars.

Trump shows off empty lectern ‘for crooked Joe Biden’

Donald Trump showed off an empty lectern erected for Joe Biden, at a rally in Wisconsin, once again challenging the president to debate him “any time, any place.” 
“We have an empty podium right here to my right. You know what that is? That’s for Joe Biden,” he told the jeering crowds in Green Bay on Tuesday night. 
“I’m trying to get him to debate. I’m calling on crooked Joe to debate anytime anyplace. We’ll do it any way you want, Joe, so that we can discuss in a friendly manner the real problems of our country of which there are many, instead of trying to have corrupt prosecutors fight your battles for you. That’s no good. Let’s go have a good, solid, friendly debate.”

Trump sues Truth Social co-founders 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 18:45 , Oliver O’Connell 
Donald Trump is suing two co-founders of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of his Truth Social network, claiming that they set up the company improperly and should lose their stock in the venture. 
TMTG went public last week, enjoying a remarkable debut on the Nasdaq exchange with shares trading at a high of $78 before plunging days later as the company’s extraordinary 2023 losses came to light – leading some to warn that it is the latest example of a volatile “meme stock” offering that has little underlying value. 
Now, the Republican presidential candidate has filed a new lawsuit against Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, two former contestants from his NBC reality show The Apprentice turned co-founders of the company.

Larry Hogan could be tough competition in Maryland Senate race for Democrats 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 18:15 , Oliver O’Connell 
John Bowden reports: 
A new poll of the US Senate race from the Baltimore Banner and Maryland’s Goucher College puts into clear view what seemed to be the dynamic from the get-go: the surprise candidacy of Larry Hogan is posing a familiar challenge for Democrats. 
The survey of voters in the state finds that Mr Hogan, a Republican former governor who won over enough Democrats in his deep-blue state to win a second term, slightly leads both of his potential Democratic challengers in hypothetical head-to-head matchups. Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks and Congressman David Trone are running in the Democratic primary to replace retiring Senator Ben Cardin, also a Democrat.

Donald Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet on what is likely to be one of the biggest foreign policy issues of his second term, should he win in November. But in the few interviews and statements he has given on Israel and the war in Gaza, the former president has shown signs that he may be cooling in his support for the longtime US ally. 
In a recent interview, the former president spoke about how he had been disturbed by images and videos showing civilians bearing the brunt of the onslaught and called for an end to the war.

Navarro, 74, surrendered to authorities on 19 March to begin a four-month sentence at the low-security FCI Miami prison in Florida after he was convicted on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to provide testimony or documentary evidence when requested by the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.

Trump and RNC raised $65.6m in March, report says 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 17:15 , Oliver O’Connell 
Politico reports that Donald Trump’s 2024 election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $65.6m in March, ending the month with $93.1m in cash on hand. 
The total covers a range of fundraising vehicles for the former president’s goal of returning to the White House, and all will have to disclose their activities to the Federal Election Commission later this month. 
Allies of Mr Trump hope it will ease some concerns that President Joe Biden is way ahead of his Republican rival in terms of fundraising, though no figures have emerged from the Democrats as of yet. It is known that the president raised $26m in a single night during a New York City fundraiser attended by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama last week. 
In February, the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee raised $53m, ending the month with $155m on hand. 
Mr Trump’s raised $20.3m in February with $40.9m on hand.

Hush money case: Manhattan DA responds to Trump motion to have case dismissed due to pre-trial publicity 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 16:21 , Oliver O’Connell 
A week after Donald Trump’s motion to delay his criminal hush-money trial due to pretrial publicity, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg files opposition—noting this is Trump’s eighth delay request. 
The DAs’ reasons are the same as they brought up in last week’s hearing: it’s unlikely to abate, jury selection can mitigate this, and the former president is making things worse. 
Ariana Baio writes: 
The argument from Alvin Bragg is that Mr Trump is making his own publicity by speaking about this trial and that if anything, the defence’s filing means it is possible to find impartial jurors. 
Further: “...despite being asked to identify new information unavailable the last time his request was denied on February 15, 2024, defendant has littered his motion with dozens of untrue allegations based on events that date back three years or more—most of which were already considered and rejected in prior decisions by this Court.” 
Trump declares Election Day ‘Christian Visibility Day’ 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 15:49 , Joe Sommerlad 
Donald Trump has promised his Christian followers that election day on 5 November will serve as “Christian Visibility Day”, predicting it will be an occasion “when Christians turn out in numbers that nobody has ever seen before” to vote him back into the White House. 
The Republican presidential contender was speaking at a rally at the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Tuesday evening when he made the remark, an allusion to the spurious outrage among Republicans caused by Trans Visibility Day happening to coincide with Easter Sunday this year. 
Properly known as International Transgender Day of Visibility but often shortened to Trans Visibility Day, the date to recognise members of America’s transgender community was founded by Michigan-based activist Rachel Crandall in 2009 and has taken place on 31 March every year since. 
In 2024, due to a quirk caused by the spring equinox, Easter Sunday fell on the same date.

Classified documents case: What was the reaction when Judge Cannon made her extraordinary jury questionnaire order? 
Wednesday 3 April 2024 15:15 , Oliver O’Connell 
Baffled. Perplexed. Bemused. 
Legal commentators weren’t sure what to make of Judge Aileen Cannon’s order regarding the jury questionnaire in Donald Trump’s classified documents case when it was issued in March, as reflected by Special Counsel Jack Smith’s response last night. 
Here’s what we reported at the time: 
Noting how “woefully unclear” Judge Cannon’s language is, legal commentator and MSNBC host Katie Phang pondered: “The PRA is clear. As is the Espionage Act. Not sure why Cannon is struggling with these concepts.” 
National security lawyer Bradley Moss also posted on X on Monday evening: “This second scenario is legally insane. If that were the case, then just grant Trump’s motion to dismiss on PRA grounds so DOJ bring it to the 11th circuit for a quick reversal.” 
Longtime Trump foe George Conway was even more scathing: “In the decades that I have been a lawyer, this is the most bizarre order I’ve ever seen issued by a federal judge. What makes that all the more amazing is that the second and third most bizarre orders I’ve ever seen in federal court were also issued by Judge Cannon in this case.” 
He later wrote: “Okay, I’ve seen enough. Not only should Aileen Cannon not be sitting on this case, but she should not be sitting on the federal bench at all. This is utterly nuts.”

2024-04-04 11:00:00,ceo optimism increases for organizations and global economy despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainty: winter 2024 fortune/deloitte ceo survey," NEW YORK, April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- 
Key Takeaways 
The ”Fortune/Deloitte CEO Survey” monitors the viewpoints and strategies of CEOs representing some of the world’s largest and most influential companies. This survey offers valuable insights into the priorities, obstacles, and anticipations of CEOs spanning over 20 industries, encompassing technology, finance, and health care. You can access the complete survey here. 
The winter 2024 survey reveals that most CEOs summarize 2023 as ”challenging,” a sentiment that has persisted as the top descriptor for four consecutive years. Looking ahead, these CEOs express significantly heightened optimism regarding both their organizations and the global economy over the next 12 months. Geopolitical instability emerges as the primary anticipated external disruptor for 65% of CEOs surveyed, followed by concerns about regulation, inflation, financial/market instability, and talent shortages. 
Despite their positive outlook for their company performance, a considerable portion of CEOs (45%) are prioritizing measures to optimize operating costs. To achieve this, they are increasingly turning to Generative AI (GenAI) and other emerging technologies. The majority of CEOs (57%) intend to integrate new technologies into their business models to uncover growth opportunities, with a significant portion (56%) already leveraging GenAI to enhance efficiency. Dive deeper into the latest insights from the ”Fortune/Deloitte CEO Survey” for further highlights. 
CEO Outlook - Economy, Company, Industry CEOs exhibit growing optimism not only towards their organizations but also the global economy, marking a significant shift from fall 2023. Among surveyed CEOs, 27% express optimism about the global economy, a substantial increase from 7% in fall 2023 and 12% a year ago, while pessimism has dwindled to 24% from 76% 18 months ago. Additionally, 22% report high optimism regarding their organizations, with 46% prioritizing new services and products over the next year. CEOs are focusing on cost optimization for growth and plan to integrate new technologies into their business models, despite moderating concerns about external factors like inflation, and other sources of financial and market instability. Most respondents anticipate the U.S. Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates by the third quarter of this year. 
Once again, geopolitical instability emerges as the top external disruptor for CEOs, with regulation following closely behind, while worries about inflation show a decline. Geopolitical instability is the foremost external factor likely to impact business strategies in the coming year, marking a 14% increase since the fall survey. Inflation, which was previously tied with geopolitical instability at 51% in the fall, has now dropped to 27%, along with other sources of financial/market instability. Regulation remains a significant concern for CEOs, standing at 36%. Concerns regarding labor and skills shortages continue to diminish, nearly halving from levels seen a year ago to 25%. 
Since the fall of 2023, there has been a marked increase in the adoption of Generative AI (GenAI), transitioning from consideration to active implementation. This trend suggests a hastened acceptance of technology. Over half (56%) of surveyed CEOs prioritize enhanced efficiency/productivity and cost reduction as the primary benefits expected from GenAI. Furthermore, 58% have already implemented GenAI to streamline manual processes, a significant rise from 40% in October 2023, with 45% leveraging these advancements to curtail operational expenses. 
According to surveyed CEOs, most CEOs and boards actively engage in succession planning, with CEOs playing a significant role throughout the process, particularly in pipeline development and succession plan formulation. While 42% of CEOs indicate their boards have established a clear process, almost 28% disagreed that their organizations have a strong bench of viable/qualified CEO candidates. A significant 84% of CEOs participate in candidate identification, with 66% emphasizing the importance of candidates’ past achievements in the selection process. 
For the fourth consecutive year, ”challenging” maintains its position at the forefront when reflecting on the preceding year. In response to summarizing 2023, most CEOs opt for ”challenging,” closely trailed by ”volatile,” echoing trends observed in the surveys conducted during the winters of 2023 and 2022. This trend isn’t unexpected, considering that most CEOs cite ”geopolitical uncertainty” as their biggest challenge, followed by concerns regarding ”growth,” the ”regulatory landscape,” ”workforce engagement,” and ”macro uncertainty.” One CEO articulates their struggle as ”Navigating the complexities of geopolitical and economic uncertainty to propel growth forward.” Looking ahead, CEOs view artificial intelligence as the next most impactful factor on their business and are actively considering its applications and potential risks.

On Wednesday, Nov. 6 — or shortly thereafter — millions of Americans will wake up to learn that their country elected a leader who will steer the country’s economy in a radically different direction than the other would if the outcome had been different.
If Donald Trump is the winner, you can expect a dramatic departure from the policies of the last four years — but who will benefit from those changes?
GOBankingRates spoke with three experts — a business consultant, retirement planner and tax professional — who each bring a unique perspective to the discussion about the potential economic impact of a second Trump presidency.

Trump’s Commitment to Low Corporate Taxes and Deregulation Could Benefit Business Owners
Philip Wentworth Jr., is a 25-year entrepreneur and co-founder of Rockerbox Tax Solutions , which provides business management and finance consulting services to small business owners. The firm helps entrepreneurs streamline financial processes, implement wealth creation strategies and mitigate tax liabilities.
After 25 years of startup, technology and business management experience, Wentworth knows that for business owners, elections matter.
“I’ve garnered deep insights into how different economic policies impact our clients,” he said. “From this vantage point, a second Trump term could notably benefit entrepreneurs and small business owners due to the continuation of lower corporate tax rates and possible further deregulatory measures. Specifically, policies that reduce bureaucratic hurdles for small businesses can accelerate growth and spur innovation, areas where our clients have seen tangible benefits.”

Trump’s Signature Achievement Was Business-Friendly Tax Cuts
Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered taxes — and revenues — across the board, but the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brookings Institute concludes that the true winners were business owners and the wealthy.
Continuar leyendo la historia
If Trump wins a second term, he’s likely to continue or expand on some of the more corporate-friendly policies he instituted the first time around, which could be a boon for business owners.
“One area that’s been particularly advantageous for small business owners under similar economic policies is the enhanced ability to leverage tax strategies such as cost segregation and Section 179 deductions,” said Wentworth. “These strategies, which can significantly lower taxable income by accelerating depreciation on business assets, could become even more accessible or expansive under a second Trump term. This accessibility directly impacts small business owners’ bottom lines, enabling reinvestment into their operations and workforce.”
Deregulation and Corporate-Friendly Tax Cuts Are a Double-Edged Sword
Regulatory and tax policies are an economic see-saw — when too much preference is given to one side, the other can plummet to earth. Two examples are the cutting of necessary social programs to compensate for lost tax revenue or when too little regulatory oversight allows for preventable corporate malfeasance.
“The implications of these policies are nuanced,” said Wentworth. “For example, while entrepreneurs and small business owners stand to gain from specific tax advantages and deregulation, the broader socioeconomic impacts, such as on consumer spending and overall economic health, must also be considered. A robust economy benefits small businesses by increasing consumer spending, but changes in healthcare or social programs could have indirect impacts.”
A Wealth Advisor Thinks His Clients — Upper-Income Investors — Have the Most To Gain
David L. Blain, CFA, is the founder and CEO of BlueSky Wealth Advisors , a fee-only, independent registered investment advisor (RIA).
A speaker and writer whose commentary has appeared in some of the country’s most prominent publications, he is a member of the CFA Institute and the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) and chairman of the Board of Directors of CarolinaEast Health System in New Bern, where he also chairs the Investment Committee. He previously served on the Board of Advisors and Finance Committee of the West Point Association of Graduates, as treasurer for Big Brothers Big Sisters of South Eastern North Carolina, president of the Cumberland Interfaith Hospitality Network and treasurer of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Raleigh.
His background gives him unique insight into how political leadership can impact everyone from the wealthy clients whose wealth he guards to the down-and-out recipients of his charitable work.
If Trump emerges victorious this November, he expects the former to do better than the latter.
“Given my experience and the analysis we’ve conducted at BlueSky, a second Trump term could potentially favor investors and those in higher income brackets due to anticipated continued deregulations and tax policies favoring capital gains and corporate profits,” he said. “These groups have historically benefited from such policies, as they often lead to increased stock market performance and real estate valuation uptrends, areas where upper-income groups are more heavily invested.”
Average Earners Could Benefit, but They’ll Get Less and It Will Take Longer
Blain believes typical people with average incomes could benefit from a second Trump term, too, but that the effects are likely to be delayed, residual and muted.
“For the middle class, any benefits might hinge on broader economic growth leading to job creation and wage increases, though these effects could be more mixed and take longer to materialize,” he said.
But the gains for those at the top and in the middle might come at the expense of the most vulnerable Americans.
“Lower-income households and seniors could find themselves facing challenges if shifts toward deregulation lead to reductions in social support programs or changes to Medicare and Social Security, as has been debated,” said Blain. “Such demographic groups typically rely more on these types of governmental support structures, which could be altered or scaled back.”
The Rich — and Their Descendants — Will Probably Get Richer
Like Blain, John F. Pace, CPA, founder of Pace and Associates CPAs , works with well-heeled clients who benefited from Trump’s first term and probably will again if he’s reelected this fall.
“Throughout my extensive 40-year career in tax and estate planning, dealing with high-net-worth individuals and managing commercial properties and private foundations, I’ve witnessed how tax policies under various administrations affect different economic strata,” he said. “My experience as a family office executive for a Forbes 400 family and my role in overseeing a tax group at U.S. Trust, which prepared thousands of tax returns, has ingrained in me a deep understanding of the nuanced interplay between tax law and economic benefit.”
He thinks a second Trump term will likely bestow most of that benefit upon the investor class.
“I’ve observed that upper-class individuals and families often stand to gain the most from a Trump-led economic policy framework,” said Pace. “This demographic can leverage lower tax rates and favorable investment conditions to further solidify and grow their wealth.”
The Children of the Aristocracy Will Inherit More Wealth
Pace concurred with most of Blain’s points and the logic supporting them, but as a tax specialist, he expanded on the wealth advisor’s assessment to include the all-important ability of the wealthiest Americans to hand down their assets unimpeded.
“Estate planning under such a framework can often be more beneficial for these individuals due to potential relaxed regulations and tax advantages on wealth-transfer mechanisms,” said Pace.
He also shares Blain’s expectation that any benefit for average earners will be diluted and distant.
“Conversely, I have seen that middle-class families and small business owners may benefit indirectly through the trickle-down effects of increased investment in the economy and potentially lower individual tax rates, which could spur job creation and raise wages. However, the magnitude and distribution of these benefits can vary widely.
“The precise impacts on low-income households, seniors and other vulnerable groups are more complex. These groups may find themselves navigating a challenging landscape if reductions in social support programs and changes to healthcare come to pass. Based on the immense diversity of clients I’ve served, the critical takeaway is that economic policies are multifaceted, with varying implications depending on one’s place in the economic spectrum.”

2024-04-04 12:51:34,british business bank extends enable funding facility with time finance," The British Business Bank has agreed a facility increase that will provide £29.4m of funding to smaller UK businesses, through an existing ENABLE Funding transaction with independent specialist finance provider, Time Finance. 
The additional funding brings the total small business funding “available through the facility to £64.4m.” 
This further supports Time Finance in “growing its pipeline and its proportion of own-book origination, so that it can provide more asset finance to UK smaller businesses.” 
The initial transaction, agreed in March 2018, was “to provide £35m of funding.” 
This was used to significantly “expand Time Finance’s asset finance lending to businesses across the UK small business sector, primarily for those seeking hard asset finance – which includes equipment with robust residual values after a period of use.” 
The first £35m facility was “provided through Time Finance plc’s wholly owned subsidiary Time Hard Asset Finance Limited.” 
As part of the increase announced today, the ENABLE Funding facility “will be extended to Time Vendor Finance Limited (also a wholly owned subsidiary of Time Finance plc) to fund a broader range of assets, including soft assets.” 
This transaction also contributes to “the British Business Bank’s objective of driving sustainable growth by increasing the supply of finance and creating a more diverse finance market for UK smaller businesses.” 
James Roberts, Chief Financial Officer, Time Finance said: 
“Over the past five years we have developed a strong working relationship with the British Business Bank and I am delighted this will now be able to continue for the foreseeable future. The enhanced facility will enable Time Finance to provide UK businesses with further funding for their business-critical equipment in one of our more secured and key strategic growth areas.” 
Reinald de Monchy, Managing Director, Guarantee and Wholesale Solutions, British Business Bank said: 
“We’re very pleased to agree this facility increase with Time Finance, which will help them to provide a more diverse range of asset finance options to small businesses across the UK. We’re also excited to see the growth this will help stimulate across the sector through the ENABLE Funding programme.” 
Launched in 2014, the ENABLE Funding program “supports the British Business Bank’s key objective to drive sustainable growth and prosperity across the UK by supporting access to finance for smaller businesses.” 
The ENABLE Funding program warehouses newly originated finance receivables from participating originators. 
Once the portfolio has sufficient scale, it aims to “refinance a portion of its funding on the capital markets, helping smaller finance providers to tap into institutional investors’ funds.” 
Time Finance’s purpose is “to Help UK Businesses Thrive and Survive through the provision of flexible funding facilities. It offers a multi-product range for SMEs concentrating on Asset, Loan and Invoice Finance. While focused on being an ‘own-book’ lender, the Group does retain the ability to broke-on deals where appropriate, enabling it to optimize business levels through market and economic cycles.” 
The British Business Bank is “the UK government’s economic development bank. Established in November 2014, its mission is to drive sustainable growth and prosperity across the UK and to enable the transition to a net zero economy, by improving access to finance for smaller businesses. Its remit is to design, deliver and efficiently manage UK-wide smaller business access to finance programs for the UK government.",0.9022342
2024-04-04 12:52:31,frax finance’s strategic leap into the cosmos ecosystem," In a significant move for the DeFi space, Frax Finance has announced its expansion into the Cosmos ecosystem, partnering with Noble, the on-chain asset issuance blockchain. 
This partnership marks a pivotal step in bringing the FRAX stablecoin and its staked version, sFRAX, from Ethereum to the Cosmos network, known for its interoperability among approximately 80 blockchains. 
A Vision for Expansion and Adoption 
At the core of this expansion lies a vision to amplify the adoption of FRAX and sFRAX across a myriad of applications, from trading to savings, payments, and collateral. Noble’s successful integration, which includes a substantial USDC circulation supply of over $195 million, serves as a testament to the potential for seamless asset integration across major Cosmos chains like Osmosis, dYdX, Celestia, Sei, and Injective. This collaboration paints a picture of a more liquid and interoperable Cosmos ecosystem, offering a decentralized stablecoin alternative with a promising outlook for widespread adoption. 
Ambitious Targets and Roadmap 
Frax Finance‘s expansion is just the beginning; the company has set its sights on a lofty goal of reaching $100 billion in assets by 2026. This aspiration is part of a comprehensive “singularity roadmap” that aims to significantly increase the TVL in its layer 2 blockchain, Fraxtal. With a current TVL of $13.2 million, the roadmap outlines the introduction of new assets and the rejuvenation of a mechanism to share protocol revenue with stakers of its native tokens. This audacious vision strives to fully collateralize the FRAX stablecoin and boost yields on sFRAX. 
The Role of Noble in Frax Finance’s Strategy 
Noble emerges as a critical player in this strategic expansion, facilitating the issuance of native digital assets within the Cosmos ecosystem. This move not only brings FRAX and sFRAX within the interoperable Cosmos network but also follows Noble’s successful track record, evidenced by its integration of Circle’s USDC. Noble’s technology enables the integration of assets with major Cosmos chains, enhancing the liquidity and utility of FRAX and sFRAX across a wide range of applications. 
Frax (FXS) and Cosmos (ATOM) Chart Analysis

The FXS chart depicts a slight recovery, with the price recently crossing above the 20-day EMA, indicating a potential shift in momentum. The positive momentum could also be the result of the expansion news. However, the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs remain overhead, suggesting that the asset is in a broader downtrend. The RSI at 64.86 points to increasing buying pressure, yet it’s not in the overbought territory, allowing room for upward movement. Traders might look for sustained price action above the 20 EMA for confirmation of a trend reversal while watching for resistance at the higher EMAs.

The Cosmos chart indicates a consolidation phase, with the price hovering near the 20-day EMA. While there has been a recent uptick in anticipation of Frax integration into its ecosystem, the price remains below major EMAs, suggesting a bearish trend. The RSI at 57.07 signifies moderate buying interest that hasn’t reached overbought levels. Investors may look for a decisive break above the 20-day EMA for a bullish signal but should be cautious of resistance from higher EMAs. 
Overall, both tokens have shown minor positive momentum, which can be based on the anticipation of the integration news, which can facilitate future adoption for both projects.

His opponent, Donald Trump, routinely claims the United States is a ”cesspool of ruin.”
By the numbers, Biden is correct: America’s economy is stronger than other developed nations.

Jonathan Ernst | Reuters
President Joe Biden is fighting to convince inflation-weary voters that the U.S. economy is healthy.
”America has the best economy in the world,” he told NBC’s Today Show on Monday, laying out an argument that is central to his reelection campaign.
America’s economic standing in the world is becoming an early flashpoint on the campaign trail, where former President Donald Trump routinely depicts the United States as a commercial wasteland.
”We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool of ruin,” Trump shouted at a Georgia rally last month, ”whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked, whose deliveries are not coming.”
But the numbers paint a different picture, one more in line with Biden’s narrative of American economic dominance than Trump’s apocalyptic warnings.
U.S. gross domestic product was 2.5% in 2023, significantly outpacing that of other developed economies, according to a January report from the International Monetary Fund . The IMF projected that the U.S. will hold that lead in 2024, though it expects GDP to come down to 2.1%.
”The U.S. economy is leading the way for the global economy. It’s driving the global economic train,” Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi told CNBC. 
Even as interest rates spiked, the labor market has stayed strong. In March, U.S. private companies added 184,000 jobs , payrolls processing firm ADP reported on Wednesday, well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate of 150,000 jobs. It is the fastest employment growth the U.S. economy has seen since July 2023.
The stock market has also made record gains over the past several months and housing values have soared, though they have now begun to decline as inventory improves.
Besides sticky high prices that are projected to cool in the coming year, Zandi said that the fundamentals of the current U.S. economy are nearly ideal: ”The economy is picture perfect. It’s hard to argue with it.”
’Policy and luck’
The U.S. economy’s recent outperformance is the result of several factors.
”It’s both policy and luck,” said economist Joseph Gagnon of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.
In response to the economic quake of the pandemic, the U.S. government injected roughly $4 trillion of stimulus into the economy to support individual households and businesses.

”We had more fiscal stimulus than any other country and that is part of the reason why the U.S. has recovered from the Covid depression better than any other country,” said economist Josh Gottbaum, a former White House and Treasury Department official in both Republican and Democratic administrations, currently a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.
America’s stimulus safety net came with a hefty price tag, leaving the U.S. with a much larger budget deficit than other countries. But it also kept the economy afloat, by providing a cushion so that companies did not have to execute mass layoffs that might have spiraled into a recession.
That labor market resilience has stuck. The unemployment rate has remained below 4% for the past two years, even as the Federal Reserve has sharply raised interest rates.
The U.S. economy’s position on the global stage is also a product of its resilience in the face of geopolitical crises, and the unique setup of the American financial system.
As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted global energy and food prices, for example, the U.S. was not hurt as much as areas like Europe and Japan, which rely more heavily on Russian energy and food imports,.
”That’s the luck part,” said Gagnon.
The U.S. economy’s resilience is also a result of its unique debt structures.

U.S. households were more insulated from spikes in global rates, because of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which allowed households to lock in extremely low mortgage rates from the early days of the pandemic. That 30-year mortgage rate, which is mostly unique to the U.S. financial system, protected households as rates later heated up.
”Our banking system takes a lot of interest rate risk, but in the rest of the world, they shove it on to the household, on to businesses,” said Zandi. ”That was really important this go around.”
Not ’free and clear’ yet
Even as the U.S. economy stays ahead of the rest of the developed world, there is still room for setbacks in the recovery.
”I don’t think we can conclude that we’ve soft landed, that we’re free and clear,” said Zandi.
Though inflation has fallen sharply from its 2022 highs, it has ticked back up in the past several months.
For now, the Federal Reserve remains hawkish on interest rates, despite previous indications the central bank would issue three cuts this year.
”On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday.

2024-04-04 13:15:00,opportunity finance network selected to receive historic $2.29 billion grant for clean energy community investments," Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund partnership with Environmental Protection Agency will transform community development finance industry with new clean energy financing ecosystem 
WASHINGTON, April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Opportunity Finance Network (OFN), the nation’s leading investment intermediary and network of community development financial institutions (CDFIs), has been selected to receive an award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA), part of the EPA’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), to finance the clean energy transition in low-income and underinvested communities nationwide. The $2.29 billion award marks a pivotal step forward in OFN’s commitment to addressing the climate crisis, advancing environmental justice, and increasing access to capital in underinvested communities. 
With more than $1 billion in total assets under management, OFN has, for nearly 40 years, represented the nation’s largest and most diverse network of community lenders. Its more than 410 active members — community investment loan funds, green banks, community development credit unions, minority depository institutions, community development banks, and venture firms — serve rural, urban, and Native communities across the country. 
OFN successfully mobilizes public philanthropic, corporate, and private investors and, since 2020, has deployed over $210 million in loans and grants to its members, including over $8 million in targeted, climate-focused investments announced at the end of 2023. 
”OFN is thrilled to partner with the EPA on this historic investment to finance the clean energy transition and drive opportunity in communities across the country through the GGRF,” said OFN President and CEO Harold Pettigrew. ”We are clear that now is the time to act on climate change, and the community development finance industry is an integral part of the solution. OFN, our network, and the community development finance industry are made for this moment, and we look forward to working with partners to deliver impact.” 
The CCIA is a $6 billion program for national nonprofit ”hubs” to deliver financial resources and technical assistance to build the climate lending capacity of community lenders working in low-income and underinvested communities. OFN aims to revolutionize the community development finance industry through new clean energy investments in underinvested communities, prioritizing climate action, equity, and community benefits. OFN will meet measurable goals with broad-based benefits in our targeted communities: reduced carbon pollution, better air quality, lower energy costs, and quality climate jobs. 
”President Biden and Vice President Harris have put communities at the center of their Investing in America agenda. Today, we’re putting an unprecedented $20 billion to work in communities that for too long have been shut out of resources to lower costs and benefit from clean technology solutions,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. ”The selectees announced today will deliver transformational investments for American communities, businesses, and families and unleash tens of thousands of clean technology projects like putting solar on small businesses, electrifying affordable housing, providing EV loans for young families, and countless others. That translates to good-paying jobs, energy bill savings, and cleaner air, all while delivering on President Biden’s historic agenda to combat climate change.” 
Under the CCIA program, OFN will distribute resources to its network of CDFIs through capitalization and technical assistance grants to build their capacity to deploy clean energy-focused capital in their communities. By building a new ecosystem of comprehensive support, OFN will empower CDFIs to scale up community investments to advance the financing of climate technologies and practices that reduce greenhouse gases and carbon emissions. 
Since its founding in 1986, the OFN network has provided over $100 billion in financing to underinvested communities across the country. Today, more than 50% of OFN’s members provide clean finance products. With demand for climate financing anticipated to exceed $14 billion over the next six years, OFN members will lend for a range of clean energy projects: rooftop and community solar, microgrids, and distributed wind power; net-zero emissions buildings; and zero-emissions transportation. 
”OFN’s CCIA program was designed in partnership with our members, who have been doing this work for decades and have earned the trust of their communities through deep engagement,” said Amber Bell, OFN’s Chief Strategy Officer. ”OFN will leverage these resources to equip our members to invest and reinvest in projects and technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support healthy communities that are resilient to the effects of climate change.” 
OFN is committed to working with diverse partners to deliver impact through the GGRF. For more information about OFN and its initiatives under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, please visit www.ofn.org/climate.

2024-04-04 11:28:49,turkey’s economy paying the price for years of policy mishaps,"Turkish leader Erdogan’s unorthodox prescriptions have tanked the lira, fueled inflation and made the nation poorer For many years, it wasn’t the economy that determined voting behavior in Turkey. The country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, won almost every election he contested despite a deteriorating economic outlook. 
This is commonly explained by the importance of identity politics in a country that has been polarised by the policies of Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development (AK) Party over its 22 years in power. 
However, Erdogan’s streak came to a screeching halt on Sunday, March 31 following Turkey’s local elections. His AK Party lost the popular vote for the first time since 2002 and the main opposition group claimed victory in key cities including Istanbul and Ankara. 
The reason why this time was different lies in the huge accumulated costs from years of policy mistakes that are now beginning to bite in a serious way. 
So, what was the economic outlook as the country went to the polls? 
On March 21, Turkey’s central bank raised interest rates unexpectedly to 50%. The move was the latest in a succession of rate rises that have followed Erdogan’s re-election as president in May 2023. It was viewed as evidence of the central bank’s determination to fight runaway inflation that is hovering close to 70%. 
The rising interest rates have been widely applauded as a much-needed reversal from the unorthodox monetary policy that had gone on far too long. Erdogan’s unconventional policy stance arose from his deep-held conviction that raising interest rates would increase inflation rather than reduce it. 
The pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused inflation to soar worldwide. While almost every central bank raised interest rates in response, Turkey went on an interest rate cutting spree. Keeping rates artificially low contributed to the rise in domestic inflation, and has made Turkey an inflation champion on a par with Argentina and Venezuela. 
Decoupling from other emerging economies 
Emerging markets have been surprisingly resilient in the face of the global financial squeeze. Unlike in the past, many emerging economies have avoided huge fluctuations in their exchange rates, have not been subject to debt distress and have managed to keep inflation under control. 
One reason for this is the success of emerging economies in improving their policy frameworks, particularly by enhancing the independence of their central banks. More specifically, central banks in these countries have significantly improved their communication and transparency, and have become much better at forecasting inflation. 
As such, countries including Chile, Czech Republic and South Africa have outperformed their counterparts in advanced economies. 
Sadly, Turkey was an outlier in this sphere. The country has completely ditched the independence of its monetary policy to such an extent that its central bank has had six different governors in the last five years. 
Politics has also played a disproportionate role in the making of economic policy. Changes to the Turkish constitution, which were put in place in 2018, gave Erdoğan significant executive powers to push for very generous spending ahead of the 2023 presidential elections. 
Minimum wage rose substantially and costly pension schemes and subsidised housing projects were put in place. This expansion in public spending naturally contributed to the inflationary pressures that were already brewing. 
Turkey’s outlier position in loose monetary policy, cutting rates between 2021 and 2023 while everyone else had been tightening, is the very reason why its central bank is now having to push rates up while others are just starting the easing cycle. 
Why does this matter? 
Getting monetary policy wrong matters for most countries. But it matters particularly for countries like Turkey that are highly open to trade and financial flows, and for whom exchange rate movements are a crucial source of fluctuation in the domestic economy. 
One of the biggest losers of Erdogan’s unorthodox monetary policy has been the Turkish lira. Over the past six years, the value of the lira has fallen dramatically against the US dollar. In January 2018, you would have needed to part with 3.76 liras to purchase one US dollar. Today, this figure stands at 31.9 liras. 
Large fluctuations in the value of the lira matter for the Turkish economy for several reasons. 
First, a significant part of Turkey’s imports are inputs used in the production process, particularly of vehicles, machinery and mechanical appliances that make up nearly half of the country’s exports. Any fall in the value of the lira will push up input costs and hence prices, reducing the competitiveness of the country’s exports. 
Second, Turkey imports a substantial part of its energy from abroad. In much the same way, any depreciation of the lira will make it more expensive to import energy. 
Third, Turkey is sitting on substantial external liabilities in foreign currency terms. This makes the depreciation of the lira even more costly. Any loss in its value magnifies the amount of resources required to repay a given level of foreign currency liabilities. 
Turkey’s return to more orthodox economic policy is good news. But it is so overdue that even the sharp reversals in policy have not been sufficient to turn the tide on its economy, especially in the fight against inflation. Persistent inflationary pressures have forced citizens to increase their holdings of foreign currency, which has put further pressure on the lira. 
Facing a slowdown in foreign capital inflows, the authorities have had to burn significant amounts of foreign currency reserves to prevent the lira from depreciating further. The sharp rise in interest rates on March 21 should be seen in a similar vein and as the price the country is having to pay for its past policy mistakes. 
More importantly, it has been nearly a year since Turkey returned to more conventional economic policy and there is no plan for a restructuring of the economy with proper institutional reform at its core. 
If proof is needed as to whether robust and independent policy institutions benefit economic performance, you need look no further than the recent resilience of other emerging economies. 
Brazil, for example, hasn’t only rebounded strongly from the pandemic. It has managed to control inflation and boasts one of the best-performing currencies in the world.

2024-04-04 14:34:24,senators demand action on ‘village militias’ financed by governors,"NAIROBI, Kenya Apr 4 — A section of Senators have called on national security
agencies to crack the whip on what they term “village militias” sustained by
Governors keen to evade accountability. 

In a response following a string of attacks aimed at Busia Senator Okiya
Omtatah, the Senators urged investigative agencies to expedite investigations
and bring culpable individuals to book.

The Senators, who included Senate Deputy Minority Whip Edwin Sifuna, decried
increasing attacks on their colleagues ostensibly to sabotage the oversight
roles in counties.

Senators demanded the Director of Criminal Investigation(DCI), Inspector General
of Police Japhet Koome, and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to
investigate the incident attack on Omtatah’s rural home that left one person
injured.

Just weeks before the raid at his rural home, Omtatah suffered an attack on
March 22 when unknown assailants accosted him while leaving Busia Law Courts.

“The relevant agencies should conduct a thorough investigation into all these
happenings to assure the Senate and the public that his life is not in danger
and not in any way related to his work as an activist or Senator,” Sifuna said.

He accused a section of county bosses of sponsoring attacks aimed at
intimidating Senators questioning the utilization of county funds.

“Some of us are facing challenges in our counties. We are under attack from our
Governors who are sending goons to us during our oversight tours and maligning
our names on social media,” Sifuna remarked.

Nominated Senator Catherine Mumma pointed an accusing finger at the Busia County
Administration led by Governor Paul Otuoma questioning why the attack happened
days after Senator Omtatah dragged the county to court.

Omtatah had filed a petition in the High Court against the Busia Governor
accusing him of undermining his oversight role.

In the petition, the senator said the Governor had failed to surrender documents
needed for an independent audit despite two letters requesting information.

Mumma urged the youth to resist attempts to unleash violence at the behest of
politicians.

We must respect democracy which allows citizens to query the Executive,” Mumma
said.

“As Senators, we will continue doing our job and mandate as required by the
public,” she emphasized.

Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei echoed his colleagues accusing county chiefs of
curtailing the legislators from demanding answers on devolved funds.

“In the recent past, there has been a well-calculated move to intimidate and
blackmail governors from doing their oversight job. The constitution didn’t
envisage this and we condemn this and call relevant agencies to move with speed
on the matter,” Cherargei stated.

Senator Cherargei claimed Governors were misusing devolved funds to organize
militia who harass Senators when they poke holes in the administration of
counties.

“Some of us have to change cars when we travel, change houses till our spouses
are accusing us of having mpango kando (extramarital affairs) yet we don’t,” he
claimed.

“We are very holy people. We have all this because of our security,” Cherargei
quipped.

Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo termed the attack on Senator Omtatah unacceptable
appealing to the security agencies to beef up security for a section of Senators
whose lives are in danger following threats and attacks from governors.

“We want to urge our county security should be alert in regards to what is
happening to senators in regards to their oversight role. Security agencies
should take action on Governors mobilizing goons,” she stated.",0.029078282

April 04, 2024 11:29 ET
| Source: Diment Diment
DUBAI, UAE, April  04, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recently, Diment is proud to announce the launch of its stable coin, Diment Dollar. In a bold move to revolutionize the stablecoin landscape, Diment Dollar emerges as a beacon of stability and security in the digital economy. With its pioneering approach, Diment Dollar challenges the traditional stablecoin model by introducing a fixed price of 1 USD and a token supply fully backed by the underlying diamond reserve value in USD.
Diment Dollar’s Diamond-Backed Stability
Diment Dollar represents a paradigm shift in the realm of stablecoins. Priced at 1 USD and backed by Diment’s diamond reserve USD-value on a 1-to-1 basis, it offers users a digital asset rooted in tangible value and stability.
Diamonds vs. Dollars: Why Diamonds Are the Future of Stablecoins
Diment Dollar boldly challenges the dominance of fiat-backed stablecoins by harnessing the inherent value of diamonds. Unlike traditional currencies subject to market fluctuations and geopolitical influences, diamonds offer unparalleled stability and intrinsic value. With a history of being the most stable investment and recognized as the ”King of Gemstones,” diamonds represent a timeless store of value. By bridging the gap between tangible assets and digital finance, Diment Dollar paves the way for a future where stability is anchored in tangible wealth rather than fiat currencies.
Diment Dollar Value Proposition
1. Diment Reserve: The diamond reserve, supported by top-tier services in the diamond industry, provides the foundation for Diment Dollar. With a rich history of collaboration and expertise, the team offers a comprehensive range of services, including acquisition, processing, and secure storage.
2. Mobile App: The forthcoming Diment mobile application serves as a convenient platform for users to manage their Diment Dollar holdings. With features such as balance tracking, transaction capabilities, and staking options, the mobile app ensures seamless access and functionality.
3. Staking: Users have the opportunity to participate in staking by locking their Diment Dollars in DD wallets for a predetermined period. During the locked period, users are rewarded with variable rates, enhancing the utility and value proposition of Diment Dollar.
4. Value-Security: Anchored by the USD-value of diamonds, Diment Dollar embodies a new era of value-security in the digital economy. Just as gold once backed the US Dollar supply, Diment Dollar instills confidence and stability in the cryptocurrency market.
5. Pre-Audited: As the first pre-audited stablecoin, Diment Dollar sets a new standard for transparency and trust. Regular audits conducted before issuance ensure the integrity of the diamond reserve, providing users with a truly pre-audited and pre-backed digital asset.
6. Pre-Backed: Each unit of Diment Dollar is supported by real diamond value, determined by the valuation of Diment’s diamond reserve in USD before issuance. This innovative approach ensures that Diment Dollar remains a stable and trustworthy digital currency.
The mission is to redefine reliability, transparency, and stability in the financial world by combining the physical value of diamonds with the potential of blockchain technology. With Diment Dollar, the aim is to secure the financial future of users and investors while adding resilience to the crypto ecosystem.
About Diment
Diment and its crypto currency Diment Dollar, is the only Stablecoin among the crypto market that is pre-backed and pre-audited. As the first Stablecoin with a fixed price of 1 USD and a token supply fully backed by the underlying diamond reserve value in USD, Diment Dollar operates in a reverse mode compared to present Stablecoins by creating value first.

2024-04-04 15:25:48,texas sees surge in job losses as greg abbott brags about economy," As Governor Greg Abbott lauds Texas for surpassing the national economic growth rate, as measured by the state’s gross domestic product, the Lone Star State faces a surge in job losses, primarily in the retail and manufacturing sectors. 
Texas saw an unexpected increase of 2,274 initial jobless claims for the week ending March 23, according to data published by the Department of Labor on April 4, casting a shadow over the state’s economic celebrations. 
In a broader context, the national landscape mirrors Texas’ labor-market challenges. Total initial jobless claims across the U.S. have risen to 221,000, the new data showed, marking an increase from the previous week’s 210,000 and exceeding analysts’ expectations of 212,000. 
Texas’ new unemployment numbers arrived days after Abbott touted the state’s economic resilience and expansion, highlighted by a 5 percent annual growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
Newsweek has contacted Governor Greg Abbott’s office for comment by email. 
The contrast of burgeoning jobless claims with a proclaimed economic prosperity raises questions about the underlying health of the state’s economy. 
With notable layoffs across several industries and warnings from the Dallas Fed about potential workforce reductions this year, the situation in Texas could be a microcosm of a larger issue that could force the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates as early as June, experts say. 
Ian Shepherdson, the chair and chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told Newsweek via email that WARN notices and Google searches for ”layoffs” point to an even greater increase in claims ahead, and a separate measure of hiring intentions is dwindling, suggesting that it may be harder for laid-off employees to find a job quickly. 
”As a result, we continue to expect labor-market developments, alongside CPI data, to guide the [Federal Reserve] to start easing in June,” he added.

Despite Abbott’s optimistic outlook, the recent uptick in jobless claims, particularly in sectors integral to Texas’ economic identity—such as retail and manufacturing—signals potential turbulence ahead. Those sectors, historically pillars of the state’s economy, now reflect the vulnerabilities faced by Texan workers. 
Abbott’s remarks on April 2 underlined his confidence in the state’s economic direction. ”Texas is again outpacing the nation in economic expansion and job growth thanks to the best business climate and the strongest workforce in America,” he said, adding, ”As we continue to invest in education, workforce development, and infrastructure, we remain focused on building an even bigger, better Texas for decades to come.” 
However, the governor’s statements stand in contrast with the layoffs affecting thousands across the state. Companies such as Tramontina USA, WWL Vehicle Services Americas and Horton Automatics have initiated layoffs, cumulatively affecting thousands of workers. And WARN notices indicate that by May, even more layoffs may be coming to the state. 
In December, the Dallas Fed warned about potential workforce reductions for Texas in 2024, predicting a challenging year ahead. The predictions, rooted in analysis of WARN notices and labor-market trends, suggested an uneasy balance between job growth and layoffs in the Lone Star State. 
The implications of the layoffs extend beyond immediate job losses and suggest a potential cooling of Texas’ economy. While Abbott champions the state’s GDP growth and job creation, the rising initial jobless claims coincide with the Dallas Fed’s predictions of an unemployment rate growing to about 4.2 percent, up from the current rate of 3.9 percent.",0.026328804
2024-04-04 16:25:13,"technology, government, financial sectors lead first-quarter job cuts","The technology, government and financial sectors made the greatest number of job
cuts during the first quarter.

Across all industries, U.S. employers announced 257,254 job cuts during the
quarter, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a Thursday (April 4) press release
.

That total was up 120% from the 117,163 cuts announced in the previous quarter
but down 5% from the 270,416 layoffs announced in the first quarter of 2023,
according to the release.

“Layoffs certainly ticked up to round out the first quarter, though below last
year’s levels,” Andy Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray &
Christmas, said in the release. “Many companies appear to bereverting to a ‘do
more with less’ approach.”

The most cited reason for job cuts during the first quarter was “cost-cutting,”
the release said. Other commonly cited reasons include restructuring; business,
unit or store closures; market conditions; and bankruptcy.

The technology industry accounted for the greatest number of job cuts in the
first quarter, per the release. The industry announced 42,442 layoffs, down 59%
from the 102,391 cuts announced during the same period in 2023.

The sectors with the next-highest number of job cuts in the first quarter were
government, financial, services and transportation, according to the release.

Financial firms cut 28,715 jobs in the first three months of 2024, down 6% from
the 30,635 cuts announced in the first quarter of 2023, the release said.

“While technology continues to lead all industries so far this year, several
industries, including energy and industrial manufacturing, are cutting more jobs
this year than last,” Challenger said in the release.

The final month of the first quarter — March — saw the highest number of job
cuts since January 2023, according to the release.

The total of 90,309 layoffs announced in March was up 7% from 84,638 in February
and up 0.7% from 89,703 in March 2023, the release said.

March’s total was the highest since 102,943 job cuts were announced in January
2023, according to the release.

This news comes a day after ADP reported that private employers added 184,000 
jobs in March, the biggest increase since July 2023.

ADP said job gains were robust throughout industries, particularly in the
leisure and hospitality space and in construction. The one exception came from
the professional services field, which saw a drop in hiring.

Kompany’s focus on Everton not struggling Burnley’s finances

No talk of finances: Burnley manager Vincent Kompany is wary of discussing what relegation from the Premier League might mean for the club’s balance sheet (Darren Staples)
Burnley manager Vincent Kompany was unhappy at being asked about the club’s finances before Saturday’s key clash with Premier League relegation rivals Everton .
The Clarets have announced losses of £27.9 million ($35.3 million, 32.5 million euros) for the year ending July 31, 2023, in their latest accounts following relegation at the end of the 2021/22 season.
Burnley are currently six points from safety with seven games to play and a second relegation in three years would undoubtedly harm the northwest club’s finances.
Kompany when questioned what the club’s losses would mean from a football perspective told reporters: ”You’re asking me this -- it’s a three-game week and in 48 hours we’ve got one of the most important games of the season.
”What benefit is that to me to start talking to you about the accounts of the club?
”The only thing I can tell you is, do we look worried, like we’ve lost control and calmness? We don’t.
”Let me focus on the Everton game right now, that’s what matters.”
Burnley may be second-bottom in the league but they are unbeaten in their last four matches and keen to close the gap to Everton, three places above and seven points better off than the Clarets.
Kompany, who guided Burnley straight back to the Premier League in his first season in charge, was in no mood to talk about what relegation might mean for the club’s medium and long-term future.
”We’re not going to talk about that right now,” the former Manchester City and Belgium star said. ”I don’t know what to say, I don’t think about it right now.
”I’ve told you many times since January, those are the discussions we have mid-season and the beginning of the season, not when we have seven games left and still everything to play for.
”The only thing I’ll try to convey as a message is it’s a scenario the club has known in the past and it’s a club that hasn’t panicked in those moments. So why all of a sudden should we? Do we have to portray a crisis just because that’s what you’re supposed to look like?
He added: ”It’s a club that’s been there before in every situation - staying up, going down -- and it’s a club that always does the right thing in those moments and that won’t change.”
Right-back Lorenz Assignon is in contention for this weekend’s trip to Goodison Park after missing the 1-1 midweek draw with Wolves through suspension.
Burnley were also without six injured players on Tuesday and Kompany said Aaron Ramsey , Luca Koleosho , Nathan Redmond , Ameen Al-Dakhil , Jordan Beyer and Han-Noah Massengo were all being assessed.

2024-04-04 21:32:40,racine county da hanson cites conflict of interest in alleged steen campaign finance fraud case," RACINE, WI — The campaign finance fraud case against Adam Steen will need to be investigated by another jurisdiction after Racine County District Attorney Tricia Hanson informed the Wisconsin Ethics Committee she and her office may have a conflict of interest. 
Steen is alleged to have been involved in an illegal campaign finance scheme between former president Donald Trump’s campaign, several Wisconsin county Republican parties, and his campaign. 
Steen ran against Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in 2022 and lost by 260 votes.

The Racine Co DA tells the state ethics committee says she has “a conflict that will prohibit myself, or my office” from charging or prosecuting Adam Steen, the GOP primary candidate who challenged Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in 2022 pic.twitter.com/iI1kzZU2Jc 
Matt Smith from WISN 12 News broke the story on X. The notice from Hanson to the WEC reads: 
I write to inform you, and the commission, that I am not able to proceed with charges involving campaign finance violations committed in Racine County by Adam Steen. After reviewing the case materials and contacting Ethics Counsel from the Wisconsin State Bar Association, I believe that I have a conflict that will prohibit myself, or my office, from prosecuting the campaign finance violations referred to me … “ 
Racine County Eye has messages into Hanson’s office for comment and will update this story if/when she returns our requests for comment. 
The case against Steen was referred to Hanson’s office by the WEC in February. She had 40 days to decide to bring charges and 60 days to prosecute before the WEC took their findings to the state Department of Justice. 
“Review of those materials will allow District Attorney Hanson to determine if additional investigation is needed, if a special prosecutor is needed, and if charges will be issued,” a press release from Hanson’s office read at the time. 
At the heart of the complaint are allegations that Trump’s campaign schemed with Rep. Janel Brandtjen (R-Menominee Falls) to illegally funnel donations over $1,000 to county Republican parties who sent the money to local campaigns, including Steen’s. 
Hanson’s inability to investigate Steen may come down to the simple fact that Hanson has made and accepted donations from Racine County Republicans, including Vos. 
A special prosecutor from a neighboring county such as Milwaukee or Kenosha will almost certainly be appointed to take the case. 
Racine County Eye will continue to update this story as details become available.

Israeli Economy and Industry Minister Nir Barkat has noted distrust of Qatar as a mediator in talks with the radical Palestinian group Hamas, Bloomberg reported. 
”They’re a wolf in sheep’s clothing. We must wake up,” he was quoted as saying by the agency. 
It was unclear from his comments if Barkat was espousing the government’s official stance or speaking personally, Bloomberg noted. 
Negotiations involving Israel and Hamas with mediation from Egypt and Qatar focusing on the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip and establishment of cease-fire in the enclave resumed in Doha on March 18. On March 29, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the decision to send delegations with representatives of security services to Qatar and Egypt to continue consultations with Hamas. The Kan radio station reported on Tuesday night that the Israeli side presented to mediators at the Cairo consultations an updated and more flexible position on the return of residents to northern Gaza in order to move toward a hostage release deal, and it was awaiting Hamas’ response. According to the radio, if Hamas responds positively Mossad intelligence chief David Barnea and ISA chief Ronen Bar may join the Cairo consultations. 
Tensions in the Middle East flared up again on October 7, 2023, after militants from the radical Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise incursion into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip, killing residents of border communities and taking hundreds hostage. Hamas described its attack as a response to the aggressive actions of Israeli authorities against the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City. Israel announced a total blockade of Gaza and started carrying out retaliatory strikes on targets in the Strip, as well as on certain areas in Lebanon and Syria. On December 1, the Israeli army accused Hamas of violating a ceasefire that had taken effect on November 24 and resumed combat operations in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians held the US responsible for the renewed Israeli aggression.",0.04624894

2024-04-05 01:50:16,visa to enhance subscription economy with new services," The global subscription market is on a steady rise, expected to reach a staggering $406B by 2025, according to an update covering the payments landscape. 
As the trend of consumers subscribing to services in sectors “such as retail, food and more increases, so does the challenge of managing their payments.” 
Recognizing this, Visa (NYSE: V), an enabler of digital payments, announced the launch of Subscription Manager, a new, all-in-one service “for financial institutions to provide Visa cardholders with a simple, convenient way to track their subscriptions, all from the palm of their hands.” 
In the era of subscription overload, consumers “are grappling with the complexities of managing multiple subscriptions across a web of apps.” 
Navigating through each platform’s unique terms can potentially “lead to unnoticed charges, even after a subscription is cancelled.” 
Visa’s new Subscription Manager streamlines key aspects of recurring payments in one place, allowing cardholders “to see where their card details are stored, view which recurring payments are attributed to their card, and stop recurring payments.” 
Kathleen Pierce-Gilmore, global head of Issuing Solutions at Visa said: 
“Managing subscriptions can often feel like a maze, with consumers sometimes feeling trapped in a cycle of confusing charges. Our goal is to make this process simpler and ensure cardholders know exactly where their money is going, and when.” 
As consumer expectations for seamless, secure digital payments grow, it’s crucial for issuers to keep pace. 
A forthcoming Visa report supports this trend, revealing “that 63% of surveyed consumers are comfortable with a future that relies entirely on digital money.” 
The rapid introduction of new digital financial tools and services “is propelling this shift, with consumers increasingly turning to apps and mobile wallets to manage their finances.” 
The same report also found that “over half of the consumers surveyed have adopted the use of mobile wallets in just the past year.” 
Subscription Manager is reportedly “the newest addition to Visa’s Digital Enablement product suite, a comprehensive set of tools and flexible solutions aimed to help issuers offer better digital experiences for their cardholders.” 
The new solution supports Visa’s ongoing efforts “to increase transparency and control in the subscription economy, building on initiatives such as its 2020 mandate that requires merchants to obtain cardholder consent after free trials or introductory promotions before initiating billing.” 
Subscription Manager is currently “in pilot in select regions.”",0.47133705

Living in multiple states and cities when he was growing up taught him to embrace diverse perspectives, said Vinay Surana, the regional managing director for Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa at insurance giant Allianz Partners.
This appreciation for different cultures and beliefs would come in handy throughout his career, where he worked in three continents and six countries.
”It was this foundation of appreciating the diversity of perspectives and including different people from different backgrounds into the team that allowed me to be successful,” he told CNBC’s My Biggest Lessons.
He believes diversity, equity and inclusion are crucial factors in attracting and retaining talent and engaging employees.
”(It] helps create a healthy workplace where each individual is comfortable in who they are, and they’re comfortable to bring their real self to the workplace. It helps reduce unconscious biases and it helps fuel innovation,” he said.

Global trade relies heavily on trade finance – a complex system that facilitates
international transactions between businesses.

While it fuels economic growth, trade finance also presents inherent risks that
financial institutions and regulators must address.

This guide delves into these risks and equips you with practical strategies to
effectively manage them.

Understanding trade finance risks

Several factors contribute to the risk landscape in trade finance.

High transaction volume and complexity

The problem

The sheer number and intricate details involved in trade transactions make it
difficult to identify suspicious activity.

Manual processes further complicate matters, increasing the chance of errors and
fraudulent documents going unnoticed.

Actionable step

Implement automated transaction monitoring systems with anomaly detection
capabilities.

These systems can analyze vast amounts of data to identify unusual patterns that
might indicate fraud, money laundering or other suspicious activity.

Time constraints and competition

The problem

Tight deadlines and fierce competition in the trade finance market can pressure
institutions to rush the due diligence process, compromising its effectiveness.

This haste can lead to overlooking red flags and approving risky transactions.

Actionable step

Establish clear timeframes for trade finance transactions. Prioritize thorough
due diligence over speed.

A well-defined process ensures all necessary checks are completed before
approving a transaction, mitigating potential risks.

Lack of standardized controls

The problem

Inconsistent regulations across different countries create loopholes that
criminals can exploit for money laundering and other financial crimes.

The lack of standardization makes it difficult for institutions to track and
monitor suspicious activity effectively.

Actionable step

Advocate for international cooperation and information sharing among regulatory
bodies.

Standardized regulations and a global information sharing framework can create a
more robust system for identifying and preventing financial crimes in trade
finance.

Dual-use goods

The problem

Trade involving dual-use goods – items with both civilian and military
applications – adds complexity and increases the risk of illegal activities.

The ambiguous nature of these goods makes it challenging to determine their true
end-use.

Actionable step

Implement robust due diligence for dual-use goods trade.

This includes conducting enhanced risk assessments, verifying licenses
thoroughly and ensuring compliance with export control regulations.

Building a strong due diligence framework

To effectively navigate these risks, financial institutions need a robust due
diligence framework.

Comprehensive risk assessments

Go beyond the basics

Regularly assess potential threats posed by various factors. This includes the
following.

 * Customer profiles – Analyze customer background, business activities, past
   transactions and reputation. Identify high-risk customers based on industry,
   location or ownership structure.
 * Transaction types – Evaluate the inherent risk associated with different
   trade finance products (e.g., letters of credit, documentary collections).
   Complex transactions or those involving large sums of money warrant
   additional scrutiny.
 * Geographic locations – Researchthe political and economic stability of
   countries involved in the transaction. Countries with high corruption or weak
   regulatory environments pose greater risks.

Develop a risk-based approach

Assign risk ratings to different scenarios based on your assessments. This
allows you to tailor due diligence procedures to the specific level of risk
associated with each transaction.

Stringent verification processes

KYC (know your customer)

Implement a robust KYC program to verify the identities and legitimacy of all
parties involved in a trade transaction. This includes the following.

 * Customer identification – Collect and verify official documents to confirm
   the identities of individuals and businesses involved.
 * Beneficiary ownership identification – Identify the UBOs (ultimate beneficial
   owners) of companies involved. This helps uncover potential shell companies
   or hidden agendas.
 * CDD (customer due diligence) – Gather information on the customer’s business
   activities, financial situation and reputation.

EDD (enhanced due diligence)

For high-risk transactions or customers, conduct deeper due diligence
investigations. This might involve the following.

 * Source of funds verification – Investigate the origin of funds being used in
   the transaction to combat money laundering risks.
 * Third-party verification – Verify information provided by the customer with
   independent sources.

Sanctions screening

 * Stay up-to-date – Utilize automated sanctions screening tools that are
   regularly updated with the latest sanctions lists from international bodies
   (e.g., OFAC, UN Security Council).
 * Screen all parties – Screen all parties involved in the transaction against
   sanctions lists, including customers, beneficiaries and intermediaries.
 * Red flag alerts – Configure screening tools to generate alerts for potential
   matches, requiring further investigation before proceeding with the
   transaction.

Strong audit trails

 * Maintain detailed records – For every trade finance transaction, maintain a
   comprehensive audit trail that includes all relevant documents, communication
   records and risk assessments.
 * Tamper-proof systems – Store audit trails in secure, tamper-proof electronic
   systems to ensure data integrity and facilitate retrievability for future
   reference or regulatory investigations.
 * Regular reviews – Conduct periodic reviews of audit trails to identify any
   patterns or inconsistencies that might indicate potential issues.

Embracing innovation for a secure future

The risk landscape is constantly evolving, demanding innovative solutions.

Digitization

One way to combat these risks is through digitization. This means using
automation and digital tools to streamline processes.

This not only reduces errors caused by humans but also speeds up transactions
and makes everything more efficient overall.

Examples of digitization in trade finance include using electronic documents
instead of paper and automating data exchange between different parties.

Blockchain technology

Blockchain uses a special digital record-keeping system that can’t be tampered
with. This makes it much more secure and transparent than traditional methods.

Blockchain has the potential to completely change trade finance by streamlining
processes, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing trust among everyone
involved.

Information sharing

Fostering a culture of information sharing among financial institutions,
regulatory bodies and law enforcement allows for quicker identification and
response to emerging threats.

This can involve creating secure platforms for information exchange and
collaborating on investigations.

Combating TBML (trade-based money laundering)

TBML requires specialized strategies.

Transaction monitoring and document review

Implement automated transaction monitoring systems and conduct meticulous
document reviews to identify suspicious activities and red flags associated with
TBML.

This helps identify suspicious activity and red flags that might indicate TBML
attempts. Examples of red flags include the following.

 * Significant price discrepancies between invoiced value and fair market value
   of goods.
 * Unnecessary complexity in trade transactions, such as unnecessary
   intermediaries or unusual routing of goods.
 * Involvement of companies or individuals located in high-risk jurisdictions
   known for weak regulations or money laundering activity.

Red flag identification

Develop and maintain a comprehensive list of red flags to detect potential TBML
attempts. Train staff to recognize these red flags and report them promptly.

Stringent import/export licensing

Collaborate with government agencies to improve import/export licensing
procedures.

This can involve stricter controls and information sharing to make it more
difficult for criminals to exploit loopholes and utilize trade for illicit
purposes.

Document verification

Implement rigorous document verification processes to detect and prevent the use
of duplicate or fraudulent documents in trade finance transactions.

This may involve collaborating with trusted third-party verification providers.

Conclusion

Trade finance plays a vital role in global trade, but it also carries inherent
risks.

Financial institutions can navigate these challenges and create a secure and
efficient trade finance landscape by adopting a multi-pronged approach.

The key to success lies in continuous monitoring. Institutions must constantly
adapt their risk management frameworks to stay ahead of evolving threats.

Additionally, information sharing plays a vital role in upholding the principles
of financial integrity.

By openly communicating suspicious activity and collaborating on investigations,
institutions can create a more secure trade finance environment for everyone
involved.
