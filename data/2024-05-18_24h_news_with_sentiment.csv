ECONOMY IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN PENNSYLVANIA: BRYAN LLENAS 
Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest as Pennsylvania gears up for its primary vote Tuesday on ’Fox Report.’ 
Sometimes there is an issue so important to a voter that it alone decides whether they can back a candidate or not. 
In 2024, three issues meet that criteria more than others:  abortion, border security, and the economy all fight for the top ”deal-breaker” spot, with different groups of voters citing each. 
At 15%, abortion edges out the economy and border security/immigration (each at 14%) as the biggest deal-breaker issue. 
DEMS PUSH BIDEN TO ACT ON FOOD PRICES WITH INFLATION RANKING AS TOP ISSUE AHEAD OF ELECTION 
Abortion is the biggest single issue among self-described Democrats (24%), suburban women (24%), self-described very liberals (23%), Black voters (17%), those with a college degree (17%), and voters under age 30 (16%).  
Border security is buoyed by being the number one deal-breaker among self-described very conservatives (28%), Republicans (25%), White men without a college degree (20%), voters ages 65+ (17%), and rural voters (17%).   
The economy is the single deciding issue among White evangelicals (19%), Hispanic voters (17%), independents (17%), Whites without a college degree (16%), and urban voters (16%).  
BIDEN DISTRICT REPUBLICAN SAYS THIS CRITICAL ISSUE WILL DEFINE 2024 ELECTIONS 
It’s no surprise the economy is a top deal-breaker issue, as views on the national economy remain negative, with 7 in 10 saying conditions are fair or poor. Still, that’s down from over 8 in 10 (84%) feeling that way in July 2022, the worst rating since President Biden took office.   
”Perceptions of the economy improving even a little is good news for the White House,” said Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducted the Fox News survey with Republican Daron Shaw. ”If more are feeling positive by the fall, it will undercut a potentially potent critique of Biden’s leadership.”  
Democratic pollster Chris Anderson said ”perceptions of the economy improving even a little is good news for the White House.” (AP/Susan Walsh) 
More than twice as many believe the economy is getting worse (64%) rather than better (30%). That’s negative overall, but an improvement from last year (70% worse, 23% better). 
”In an interview last week, Biden claimed he had already fixed the economy,” said Shaw. ”That’s probably not a statement that will inspire confidence among the vast majority of Americans who are still feeling the effects of seven dollars for a box of Cheerios.” 
Foreign policy is low on voters’ priority list (4% call it a deal-breaker issue), even amid ongoing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. 
Views are mixed on what to do in international hotspots. On Ukraine, voters break roughly into thirds between thinking the U.S. should be doing more to help the country in its fight against Russia (29%), doing less (35%), and thinking support is about right (33%). Democrats are more likely to feel the U.S. should be doing more for Ukraine (45%) while Republicans (53%) and independents (42%) say less. 
In the Middle East, voters continue to be split over U.S. support for Israel: 32% say the U.S. is too supportive, 30% say not supportive enough, and 33% say support is about right. Once again, partisans are divided as half of Republicans believe there’s not enough support for Israel (50%), while 4 in 10 independents say there’s too much support (41%), and Democrats divide between saying too much support (39%) and support is about right (44%). 
When it comes to views of the leaders directly involved in these conflicts, Russian President Vladimir Putin does the worst, with just 9% having a favorable view of him and 86% holding a negative opinion. That’s about where views of him have stayed for the last five years.  In 2002, the first time the poll asked about Putin, 23% said favorable vs. 13% unfavorable and 64% couldn’t rate him, unlike today where just 6% are unable to offer an opinion.  
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a 27% favorable rating (45% unfavorable), while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy garners 40% favorable (31% unfavorable).  Roughly 3 in 10 can’t rate either leader. 
A LOOK AT STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS… 
Student loan forgiveness has had a major moment over the past year. Last summer, the Supreme Court struck down the Biden administration’s first executive order on tackling college debt, and in April it proposed another plan to provide relief for millions of borrowers. Potential costs to fund these plans could reach billions or even trillions of dollars.  
Supporters of student debt forgiveness demonstrate outside the US Supreme Court on June 30, 2023, in Washington, DC.  (Oliver Douliery) 
Over half of voters (52%) oppose the idea of using U.S. taxpayer money to help individuals pay off their college loan debt, while 46% are in favor of the relief.  
Those most likely to reject it are Republicans (76%), White evangelical Christians (69%), White men without a college degree (66%), voters ages 65 and over (63%), and rural voters (62%).  
Democrats (71%), those under age 30 (69%), Black voters (67%), and urban voters (60%) are in favor of such a plan, while independents are more likely to oppose (53%) than favor it (44%).  
By an 8-point margin, voters with a college degree (51%) are more likely than those without a degree (43%) to favor loan forgiveness.  
DAD WHO SACRIFICED HIS SAVINGS TO PAY FOR SON’S COLLEGE CALLS STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS A ‘BITTER PILL’ 
When asked whether college loan costs are a problem, 4 in 10 voters say they are (24% say a ”major” problem). That is the lowest in a list of costs, including grocery prices (89% a problem), gas prices (84%), utilities (81%), health care (80%), and housing costs (74%). 
Even voters under age 30 rank student loan costs last.  
THE MARIJUANA QUESTION… 
Juan Bermeo collects signatures for an initiative petition that would appear on the ballot as State Question 820, to legalize recreational marijuana. (Doug Hoke) 
In April, the Drug Enforcement Administration proposed a rule to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug and today the Department of Justice notified the Federal Register of the proposed rule, formalizing the process.   
Still, it would not legalize it outright, something a majority of voters back: 69% favor legalizing marijuana nationwide for recreational use while 30% oppose. That’s up from five years ago when it was 63-34% favor/oppose. 
Since December 2019, increases in favor of marijuana legalization can be seen across the board, with those most likely to favor it including liberals (84%), Democrats (81%), voters under age 30 (79%), and urban voters (76%), and nonwhites (71%). 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE 2024 GENERAL ELECTION… 
Given the closeness of the presidential election contest — former President Trump currently tops President Biden by one point — it is likely whoever voters see as better able to handle their deal-breaker issue will have an edge on Election Day.   
Trump does better on two of the top three, holding double-digit leads on immigration (+15) and economic issues (+13), while Biden is seen as better on abortion (+8). Trump is also favored on crime (+8) and foreign policy (+5), whereas more trust Biden on health care (+7) and election integrity (+7).  The two tie on energy policy. 
In addition to winning on the important issues, gaining the support of key constituencies is going to be a major factor for the 2024 race. 
The under 30 crowd has been a much-discussed key group this cycle and while Biden won them handily in 2020 (by 25 points according to the Fox News Voter Analysis), he struggles with them now. An aggregation of the last three Fox News national surveys shows Trump leading Biden by 8 points among this group (53% Trump, 45% Biden). That’s despite younger voters being more likely to think the U.S. is too supportive of Israel, favoring legalizing marijuana and using U.S. taxpayer money to cancel student debt, and citing abortion as their top deal-breaker issue.

”On many foreign policy and social issues, younger people prefer policy solutions associated with the left,” says Shaw. ”But it’s not student loans or Gaza that are the true source of disaffection. The larger issue is younger voters are deeply concerned about the future and see both sides as old, out of touch, and unable to frame politics in a compelling way.”

There are tangible results in the field of transport infrastructure construction,” he said.

2024-05-16 22:13:21,"dow jones industrial average briefly hit 40,000 amid renewed hopes for u.s. economy"," The Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index touched 40,000 briefly for the first time Thursday amid renewed investor hopes for a ”soft landing” for the U.S. economy following a favorable inflation report. 
It retreated slightly at the market close, landing at 39,869. 
The index, which is comprised of the stocks of 30 major companies such as Apple and McDonald’s, has gained a modest 6% on the year. The other major U.S. stock indices, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, also hit record highs and have outpaced the Dow with their year-to-date gains. 
The Biden-Harris campaign released a statement calling the milestone “just another example of how President Biden is strengthening our economy and helping to secure the retirement of millions of Americans across the country.” 
Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the Consumer Price Index climbed 3.4% for April — below analysts’ expectations and with a clear trend toward further deceleration, or slowing price growth. 
“The news on Core inflation [excluding food and energy prices] was better than expected,” Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US, said in a statement. “Core goods [like cars] continue to be in outright deflation, housing inflation decelerated, and other services improved on a month-to-month basis. Retail sales also showed some deceleration from the previously hot consumer sector. “ 
Investors tend to favor deceleration because it means prices are still moving up — but at a more sustainable rate. This also has implications for interest rates — the cost of borrowing money for everything from credit cards to auto loans and, indirectly, for mortgage rates. 
Markets had a rough spring, as three consecutive reports showed the inflation rate picking up speed — from 3.1% in January to 3.5% in March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 5% between the end of March and the beginning of April as economists and investors fretted over whether or not progress on inflation had stalled. 
The April report, which reflected the first slowdown in inflation since the beginning of the year, appears to have alleviated some of those concerns. 
”Following three months of inflation upsets, the April report put a soft landing and 2024 rate cut back in investors’ sights,” Julia Pollak, ZipRecruiter’s chief economist, said in a statement. 
The Federal Reserve continues to target an inflation rate of 2%. If the central bank believes price growth is slowing toward that figure, it may consider cutting its key interest rate from the nearly 5.5% level it’s been at for about a year. 
If interest rates move down, it would help lower monthly payments faced by businesses and consumers alike throughout the economy. 
Of course, the stock market is also tied to company earnings — and right now, publicly traded firms are reporting robust profits. In the first quarter of the year, about three-quarters of all firms beat their earnings estimates, a higher rate than the historical average. 
Early Thursday, Walmart joined their ranks when it reported earnings above analysts’ expectations. 
“A bad economy? Publicly traded American companies aren’t seeing it, as corporate earnings expectations move steadily higher,” Bankrate analyst James Royal said in a statement. ”Strong current earnings and increased earnings expectations are pushing the S&P 500 to new all-time highs.” 
A stronger stock market should also provide a windfall to the many Americans watching their 401(k) balances. A Bank of America Institute report on retirement savings showed the average account balance increasing from $78,883 in March of last year to $92,142 in March of this year, a nearly 17% jump. 
But for many consumers, especially lower incomes ones, the U.S. economy still does not feel great. The latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey has fallen to its lowest level in six months. The New York Federal Reserve’s latest survey of consumer expectations showed Americans expecting inflation to actually worsen in the short term, though the report came about before this week’s inflation report. 
The report also showed workers are feeling less certain about the labor market, with the mean perceived probability of finding a job if one’s current job was lost declining to its lowest reading since April 2021. 
But in the aggregate, the majority of data points show a U.S. economy that is humming along. 
”The still healthy consumer, strong labor market, potentially lower rates helping housing, and improving manufacturing all suggest an economy that could surprise to the upside the rest of ‘24,” Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, wrote in a note earlier this month.

2024-05-16 22:56:49,"crédits impôts recherche, comment financer son innovation ?","Propos� par Myriad consulting
Financer votre innovation simplement avec les cr�dits imp�ts.
Vous cherchez � maximiser vos financements d’entreprises ? Alors le cr�dit imp�ts peut vous accompagner dans cette d�marche.
Les crédits d’impôt, tels que le Crédit Impôt Recherche (CIR) ou le Crédit Impôt Innovation (CII) sont des mesures mises en place par les gouvernements pour encourager les entreprises à innover et à investir dans la recherche et le développement. 
En bref, ces crédits permettent de réduire le montant des impôts à payer et peuvent également être remboursés sous forme de subvention si l’entreprise n’a pas suffisamment de bénéfices pour les déduire.
Pourquoi ce dispositif est intéressant pour votre entreprise ? 
Pour les entreprises innovantes, les crédits d’impôt peuvent représenter une source de financement non négligeable pour leurs projets de R&D. Vous pourrez ainsi développer un avantage concurrentiel via de nouveaux produits.  
Le développement d’un avantage concurrentiel
Grâce aux crédits d’impôt, les entreprises peuvent récupérer une partie des dépenses engagées dans leurs projets d’innovation, ce qui leur permet de réinvestir ces fonds dans de nouveaux projets et de continuer à se développer. 
L’argument de taille pour convaincre les investisseurs et la BPI
De plus, les crédits d’impôt peuvent également être un argument de poids pour convaincre des investisseurs potentiels de soutenir financièrement l’entreprise, car cela démontre la capacité de l’entreprise à innover et à se positionner sur des marchés compétitifs.
La BPI France peut, pour certaines de ces subventions, vous demander d’effectuer les démarches CIR ou CII. 
Bon à savoir
Cependant, ces projets peuvent être coûteux et demander des investissements importants en termes de ressources humaines et matérielles. 
Revenons désormais sur les trois crédits d’impôts principaux. 
Le Crédit Impôt Recherche (CIR) 
Le Crédit Impôt Recherche est un dispositif fiscal qui permet aux entreprises de bénéficier d’un crédit d’impôt calculé sur les dépenses de recherche et développement engagées. 
Ce crédit d’impôt représente 30 % des dépenses de recherche éligibles pour les entreprises réalisant moins de 100 millions d’euros de chiffre d’affaires et 5 % au-delà. 
Les dépenses de recherche éligibles comprennent notamment les salaires des chercheurs, les dépenses de fonctionnement des laboratoires, les brevets, etc. 
Le Crédit Impôt Innovation (CII) 
Le Crédit Impôt Innovation est un dispositif fiscal destiné aux petites et moyennes entreprises (PME) qui réalisent des dépenses d’innovation. 
Les entreprises éligibles peuvent bénéficier d’un crédit d’impôt de 20 % des dépenses d’innovation engagées dans la limite de 400 000 euros par an. 
Les dépenses d’innovation éligibles comprennent notamment les dépenses de design, de conception de prototypes, de nouveaux procédés de production, etc. 
Le CII vise à encourager les PME à investir dans l’innovation pour améliorer leur compétitivité et favoriser leur croissance.
Le statut Jeune Entreprise Innovante (JEI) 
Le statut de Jeune Entreprise Innovante est un dispositif spécifique en France qui permet aux jeunes entreprises de moins de 8 ans et réalisant des dépenses de recherche et développement éligibles d’obtenir des avantages fiscaux. 
Les entreprises bénéficiant du statut JEI peuvent notamment être exonérées d’impôt sur les bénéfices pendant les deux premières années d’existence, puis bénéficier d’une réduction d’impôt de 50 % sur les bénéfices au-delà. 
Ce statut offre également des exonérations de cotisations sociales pour les salariés impliqués dans les activités de recherche et développement. Le statut JEI vise à soutenir et encourager les jeunes entreprises à investir dans l’innovation et à développer des projets ambitieux. C’est un véritable coup de pouce pour les startups et les entreprises en phase de croissance qui ont besoin de ressources financières pour mener à bien leurs projets innovants. 
En bénéficiant du statut JEI, ces entreprises peuvent bénéficier d’un cadre fiscal avantageux qui leur permet de se concentrer sur leur développement et leur stratégie d’innovation, sans se soucier des contraintes financières liées à l’impôt sur les bénéfices.
Les subventions européennes 
En plus des crédits d’impôt nationaux, les entreprises innovantes peuvent également bénéficier de subventions européennes pour financer leurs projets de recherche et développement. 
Le programme phare de l’Union européenne en matière de financement de l’innovation est Horizon Europe, qui propose différents types de subventions, telles que : 
• les subventions de recherche et d’innovation, 
• les bourses individuelles pour les chercheurs, 
• les prêts pour les PME innovantes, etc.
Les subventions européennes offrent une opportunité supplémentaire aux entreprises de financer leurs projets d’innovation et de renforcer leur compétitivité sur le marché international. Ces subventions peuvent couvrir une partie importante des coûts liés à la recherche et au développement, ainsi que des coûts annexes tels que la propriété intellectuelle, la formation, les frais de déplacement, etc.
D’autres programmes peuvent vous être nécessaires pour maximiser vos financements, tels que : 
• Eurêka Eurostars
• EIC Accelerator 
En conclusion, les subventions publiques, telles que les crédits d’impôts ou les subventions européennes, sont un outil précieux pour financer l’innovation des entreprises. En les utilisant de manière stratégique, les entreprises peuvent bénéficier d’un soutien financier important pour leurs projets de recherche et développement et renforcer ainsi leur compétitivité sur le marché.

2024-05-16 23:33:13,treasury department to use ‘automation and innovation’ to fight illicit finance," The Department of the Treasury has outlined the priorities it will pursue this year to step up the fight against illicit finance. 
The agency aims to increase transparency, leverage partnerships and support responsible technological innovation, it said in a Thursday (May 16) press release announcing the publication of its “2024 National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing.” 
One of the Department’s priorities for the year is closing legal and regulatory gaps in the country’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, according to the release. It aims to do so by operationalizing the beneficial ownership information registry; finalizing rules covering the residential real estate and investment advisor sectors; and assessing the vulnerability of other sectors. 
A second priority is promoting a more effective and risk-focused AML/CFT regulatory and supervisory framework for financial institutions, the release said. The Department will work to do so by providing clear compliance guidance, sharing information and providing resources for supervision and enforcement. 
The Department also aims to enhance the operational effectiveness of law enforcement, other U.S. government agencies and international partnerships to combat illicit finance, per the release. 
The fourth priority announced in the press release is realizing “the benefits of responsible technological innovation” by developing new payments technology, supporting the use of new mechanisms for compliance, and using automation and innovation to find new ways to fight illicit finance, the release said. 
“In this critical moment for our national and economic security, we need to continue to close the pathways that illicit actors seek to exploit for their schemes,” Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in the release. “We recognize the threat illicit financial activity represents to our national security, economic prosperity, and our democratic values, and are focused on addressing both the challenges of today and emerging concerns.” 
These recommendations are meant to address key risks the Department of the Treasury identified in February in its “2024 National Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing Risk Assessments.” 
In another recent move, the Treasury Department said in April that it wants more tools to curb terror financing. 
In testimony released ahead of an April 9 appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said terrorist groups and state actors continually “seek new ways to move their resources in light of the actions we are taking to cut them off from accessing the traditional financial system.”

2024-05-16 23:26:06,un reports improved prospects for the world economy and forecasts 2.7% growth in 2024," UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations reported improved prospects for the world economy since its January forecast on Thursday, pointing to a better outlook in the United States and several large emerging economies including Brazil, India and Russia. 
According to its mid-2024 report, the world economy is now projected to grow by 2.7% this year – up from the 2.4% forecast in its January report – and by 2.8% in 2025. A 2.7% growth rate would equal growth in 2023, but still be lower than the 3% growth rate before the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. 
”Our prognosis is one of guarded optimism, but with important caveats,” Shantanu Mukherjee, director of the U.N.’s Economic Analysis and Policy Division, told a news conference launching the report. 
The report pointed to interest rates that are higher for longer periods, debt repayment challenges, continuing geopolitical tensions and climate risks especially for the world’s poorest countries and small island nations. 
Mukherjee said inflation, which is down from its 2023 peak, is both “a symptom of the underlying fragility” of the global economy where it still lurks, “but also a cause for concern in its own right.” 
“We’ve seen that in some countries inflation continues to be high,” he said. “Globally, energy and food prices are inching upward in recent months, but I think a bit more insidious even is the persistence of inflation above the 2% central bank target in many developed countries.” 
The U.N. forecast for 2024 is lower than those of both the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
In mid-April, the IMF forecast that the world economy would continue growing at 3.2% during 2024 and 2025, the same pace as in 2023. And the OECD in early May forecast 3.1% growth in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025., 
The latest U.N. estimates foresee 2.3% growth in the United States in 2024, up from 1.4% forecast at the start of the year, and a small increase for China from 4.7% in January to 4.8%. for the year. 
Despite climate risks, the report by the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs forecasts improved economic growth from 2.4% in 2023 to 3.3% in 2024 for the small developing island nations primary due to a rebound in tourism. 
On a negative note, the report projects that economic growth in Africa will be 3.3%, down from 3.5% forecast at the beginning of 2024. It cited weak prospects in the continent’s largest economies – Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa – along with seven African countries “in debt distress” and 13 others at ”high risk of debt distress.” 
Mukherjee said the lower forecast for Africa “is particularly worrying because Africa is home to about 430 million (people) living in extreme poverty and close to 40% share of the global undernourished population” and ”two-thirds of the high inflation countries listed in our update are also in Africa.” 
For developing countries, he said, the situation isn’t “as dire” but an important concern is the continuing fall and sharp decline in investment growth.",0.58166623

Consumers have evolved, adapting to new payment experiences – “from the advent of embedded, digital commerce to the rapid adoption of ‘the tap’.” 
At the Visa Payments Forum in San Francisco, Visa unveiled new products and services that will enhance “the card and address the future needs of businesses, merchants and consumers and the financial institutions that serve them.” 
Jack Forestell, Chief Product and Strategy Officer, Visa said: 
“The industry is at a pivotal point – new technologies like Gen AI are rapidly shifting how we shop and manage our finances. We’re announcing the next generation of truly digital-native payment card experiences. Today we unveiled new card features and digital innovations that will bring consumers into a more customized, convenient and secure future.” 
The new products and services Visa unveiled today, which will begin to roll out later this year, include: 
Visa Flexible Credential 
A Visa study found that more than half of card users “want the power to access multiple accounts through a single credential.” 
The Visa Flexible Credential will “allow a single card product to toggle between payment methods, putting the power of choice in the hands of the consumer. Now people can easily set parameters or choose whether they use debit, credit, “pay-in-four” with Buy Now Pay Later or even pay using rewards points.” 
Visa Flexible Credential is live in Asia and will be launching with Affirm later this summer in the U.S. 
Tap to Everything 
There are six billion mobile devices in the world “providing consumers with a versatile NFC enabled device primed to be ‘tapped.’ At the end of 2023,” 
Visa’s tap to pay penetration reached 65% globally, “up two times the penetration we saw in 2019, cementing tap as one of the best commerce experiences today.” 
This year, new ways to “tap” on a mobile device “will become an integral part of the Visa experience.” 
Visa Payment Passkey Service 
Identifying a person in the digital world has “become incredibly complex and has resulted in a significant increase in fraud. Today, online payment fraud is seven-times higher than in-person payments.” 
Built on the latest Fast Identity Online (FIDO) standards, the Visa Payment Passkey Service confirms a consumer’s identity and “authorizes online payments with a quick scan of their biometrics like a face or fingerprint.” 
When shopping online, Visa passkeys replace “the need for passwords or one-time codes, enabling more streamlined, secure transactions.” 
Forestell added: 
“There is a global desire to find commonality, interoperability and simplicity for online payments. Our passkeys, designed specifically for payments, represent a massive paradigm shift in our industry because it confirms identity without interrupting the checkout experience. Visa Payment Passkey Service increases security while reducing friction when you pay online, across any device or website, globally.”

2024-05-16 07:32:40,pakistan’s economy faces structural challenges amid political uncertainty,"KARACHI, PAKISTAN, MAY 16 – DESPITE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN MACROECONOMIC
INDICATORS, THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GRAPPLE WITH STRUCTURAL BOTTLENECKS
EXACERBATED BY POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES AND INCONSISTENT POLICIES, SAID THE STATE
BANK OF PAKISTAN (SBP) ON TUESDAY.
In its six-monthly report on ‘The State of Pakistan’s Economy,’ the central bank
identified major issues including limited savings, low investments in physical
and human capital, weak productivity, stagnant exports, a narrow tax base, and
inefficiencies in public sector enterprises (PSEs).

“Political uncertainty exacerbates the situation through inconsistency in
economic policies, weak governance, and public administration, hindering
investment and thus economic development,” the report stated, emphasizing the
need for policy reforms to ensure sustainable development over the medium to
long term.

The SBP projected the average Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in the range
of 23-25 percent for FY24, down from 29.2 percent in FY23. It is expected to
fall to a range of 5-7 percent by September 2025. Despite subdued domestic
demand and a decline in global commodity prices, lingering structural issues,
rupee depreciation compared to H1-FY23, increased government spending, and
supply shocks kept National CPI (NCPI) inflation at elevated levels.

“Higher input costs, increased indirect taxes, and the implementation of upward
revisions in the minimum wage announced in the FY24 budget, alongside the
second-round effects of administered prices of food and energy items,
contributed to persistent core inflation during H1-FY24,” said the report.

According to the report, real economic activities moderately recovered from last
year’s contraction, while the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF helped
reduce stress on external accounts.

The SBP expects a continuation of modest economic recovery in the second half of
FY24. With improvements in business confidence, high-frequency demand indicators
since November 2023, and prospects for good wheat production during FY24, the
SBP projects real GDP growth in the range of 2-3 percent for FY24. Despite
uncertainties in the domestic economy and international commodity markets, the
NCPI inflation is expected to remain on a downward trajectory.

On the external account, the current account deficit (CAD) is projected to
remain lower than earlier estimates amid a slightly improved global outlook and
domestic growth prospects boosting foreign exchange earnings from exports and
remittances. The SBP projects the CAD to be 0.5-1.5 percent of GDP for FY24.

“This macroeconomic outlook remains susceptible to escalating geopolitical
tensions, unfavorable weather conditions, adverse movements in global oil
prices, and subsequent external account pressures,” the report stated, adding
that further adjustments in energy prices and fiscal consolidation needed to
slow debt accumulation may also weigh on economic activities and inflation.

Meanwhile, the CAD narrowed considerably amid continued contractionary monetary
and fiscal policies, better agricultural production, and easing global commodity
prices, the report concluded.",0.033221744

. 
The lender has provided a stretch senior acquisition loan of £5.71 million against a freehold vacant 50,000 sq ft office building on a three-acre site in Hainault, north east London. Although the property does not benefit from planning permission, GRE Finance was able to provide a loan at 95% LTPP given the extremely strong planning case, very experienced sponsor and access to further equity if needed. 
The property is allocated in the Redbridge Local Plan as an ‘opportunity site’ with strong potential to come forward for residential and mixed-use development. The borrower, Medina Capital Investments, intends to submit a planning application for a residential development of c. 50 townhouses and a block of 40 affordable apartments. Upon completion, the scheme will have a GDV of approximately £50 million. 
GRE has also agreed a second senior loan of £3.7 million against a freehold, operational, 82-room hotel in Burnham. The agreement will refinance existing debt on the property and pay for the continued refurbishment of the Burnham Beeches Hotel, bringing its GDV to c. £16 million after stabilisation. The property is 1.2 miles north of Burnham Station, with services on the Elizabeth Line and main line offering direct routes into London Heathrow airport, as well as Paddington, Maidenhead and Reading, and is set among 7.7 acres of landscaped gardens, function rooms, a swimming pool, and a fitness and wellness centre.

Latest Research: China Supplies Russia’s War Economy with Microelectronics
The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has for the second time since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine investigated how the Russian arms industry is supplied with goods from abroad

After appointing economist Andrei Belousov as the new Minister of Defense, Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to visit Chinese President Xi Jinping. According to claims in a new American study, since 2023, China has become the most important supplier of microelectronics and machinery used for Russian weaponry.
Putin is showing his intention to further shape the Russian industry into a wartime economy. As early as the end of 2023, the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) calculated in one analysis that in the worst-case scenario, the Western military alliance only had five more years to maintain its deterrence potential against a possible Russian attack on a NATO country.

The author of that study, Christian Melling, head of the Center for Security and Defense at DGAP, has now updated his analysis focusing on the strengthening of the Russian military in the war against Ukraine. ”Putin is only living through this war,” claims the German expert in an interview with DW .
”He needs the war because he has summoned so many spirits that may not be able to accept peace at all.” Therefore, NATO’s rearmament is directly linked to supplying weapons to those 50 nations, led by the United States, supporting Ukraine.
The American Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concluded in its study published in April that ”Putin’s ongoing and comprehensive military reforms” in the war against Ukraine indicate that ”Russia may be preparing for conflict with NATO within the next two decades, including conventional warfare on a large scale.” CSIS, based in Washington, reportedly close to the US arms industry, has investigated for the second time since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine how the Russian arms industry is supplied with goods from abroad and how it avoids Western sanctions.
This study was published under the title ”State of the Russian Defense Industry after Two Years of War.”

To do this, researchers analyzed publicly available data on the movement of goods into Russia, particularly microelectronics needed for missiles and so-called ”gliding bombs.” CSIS also tracked the trade of so-called CNC machines, or computer-controlled metalworking machines used for making artillery shells and other ammunition.
”The Russian defense industry has found ways to obtain what it needs to increase weapon production,” concludes the analysis by American CSIS. ”The Kremlin continues to rely on components imported through a complex network of intermediaries.
This has proven crucial for supplying the Russian military in Ukraine,” the study assesses. According to these estimates, China became Russia’s most important supplier as of spring 2023: ”Almost all leading exporters of microelectronics are based in China and Hong Kong, with one company based in Turkey,” the study notes.

Chinese exports of microelectronics to Russia sharply increased in March 2023.
At that time, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. ”Russian imports of CNC machines from Chinese firms used for precise production of parts for various weapon systems, from ammunition to aircraft, also sharply increased in the months following the meeting between Xi and Putin in March 2023,” CSIS notes.
The American think tank also published several graphs showing that between March and July 2023, companies from China and Hong Kong supplied Russia with electronics between 200,000 and 300,000 times each month.
Many drones for Moscow, few for Kiev
A particularly striking comparison is the delivered unmanned aerial vehicles: ”Russia received unmanned aerial vehicles directly from Chinese trading companies worth at least $14.5 million, while Ukraine received only Chinese-made drones and components worth around $200,000, mostly from European intermediaries,” the CSIS report states.
Some of the companies from China and Hong Kong that supply Russia also do business with Ukraine. And if these firms are under EU or US sanctions, then that creates a problem because trade restrictions can eventually affect Ukraine too.
Finally, American researchers concluded that ”the Russian industrial sector has become entirely dependent on China when it comes to machines and components essential for weapons production.” This is confirmed by investigations conducted in Ukraine, where Russian missiles, gliding bombs, and drones intercepted by Ukrainian air defense are dismantled into parts.
Since last year, the Ukrainian military has been finding Chinese electronics in Russian weapons, primarily, reports sanctions expert Vladislav Vlasijuk, working in the administration of the President of Ukraine. Unlike before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia is increasingly producing types of ammunition and weapons where Western high-tech components are entirely replaceable.
Primarily, this concerns gliding bombs and combat drones Shahid, which originally come from Iran. In this way, since the beginning of 2024, the Russian Air Force has been more successfully overcoming Ukrainian air defense, which, on the other hand, lacks Western missiles for defense, reports Deutsche Welle .

U.S. Treasury yields held steady on Friday as investors considered the state of the economy as they digested the week’s economic data.
At 3:27 a.m. ET, the yield on the 10-year Treasury
was up by less than one basis point 4.3788%. The 2-year Treasury
yield was last at 4.7799% after dipping by just over one basis point.
Yields and prices have an inverted relationship. One basis point equals 0.01%.

Investors weighed the state of the U.S. economy and the path ahead for monetary policy after the latest economic data and comments from Federal Reserve officials.
Data released Thursday showed that import prices soared 0.9%, far higher than the 0.3% Dow Jones estimate, while the latest weekly initial jobless claims figures were broadly in line with expectations.
This comes after several key inflation readings earlier in the week. April’s consumer price index came in 0.3% higher from the previous month and rose 3.4% from a year earlier. The monthly figure was just below forecasts, while the annual reading was in line with expectations.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic on Thursday said that he was pleased with the progress on inflation in April, but that the central bank should stay ”patient and vigilant” and was ”not there yet.”
Fed officials in recent weeks have indicated caution when it comes to monetary policy plans, especially regarding interest rate cuts. Policymakers have widely suggested that they were still waiting for more evidence that inflation is easing sustainably, and that this may take some time. Additional remarks from central bank officials are expected Friday and throughout the coming week.
Earlier in the week the producer price index for April had reflected an increase of 0.5% on a monthly basis in April, which was above previous expectations.",0.54515606

In April, China’s retail sales growth decelerated while industrial activity remained robust, according to data released on Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics.
What Happened: Retail sales in April increased by 2.3% year-over-year, falling short of the 3.8% forecasted by a Reuters poll. This growth was also slower than the 3.1% reported in March.
On the other hand, industrial production surged by 6.7% in April, surpassing the anticipated 5.5% growth and marking a significant increase from the 4.5% in March.
Fixed asset investment for the first four months of the year rose by 4.2%, lower than the expected 4.6% increase. Real estate investment, however, saw a steeper decline, down by 9.8% year-on-year for the first four months of 2024.
Despite the overall slowdown, retail sales grew by 6.8% year-on-year during a recent holiday period from Apr. 29 to May 3, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce.
Alibaba Group Holding Limited is trading at HK$ 85.15 on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, marking a 6.84% increase. JD.com, Inc. is trading at HK$ 132.90, with a slight rise of 0.38%. Additionally, PDD Holdings Inc. is trading at HK$ 143.38, also up by 0.36% after the data release.
Meanwhile, key China-focused ETFs such as KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB, KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A 50 Connect Index ETF KBA, iShares MSCI China ETF MCHI, and iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI have outperformed major U.S.-equity ETFs , signaling a potential shift in the market landscape.",0.14890487
2024-05-17 06:34:00,the g7 will support the eu initiative to use frozen russian assets to finance the reconstruction of ukraine," G7 
The G7 countries will support the European Union’s initiative to confiscate income from Russian assets for the benefit of Ukraine from May 20, Reuters reported. 
The G7 countries will support the EU proposal at the meeting at the finance ministers meeting in Stresa on May 24-25, Reuters’ sources said. 
The discussions will concern the use of income from Russian assets, and not the assets themselves, an anonymous official said. 
Any decision should have support among EU countries and a ”strong legal basis,” the source added. 
The finance ministers will have to carry out preparatory work that will enable the leaders of the G7 countries to make a final decision at the summit in June, he clarified. 
Struggle over Russian assets 
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a bill on Jan. 24 that would allow for the confiscation of Russian assets and their transfer to Ukraine to rebuild its infrastructure. 
The U.S., together with the EU, was considering legal authority to direct $300 billion in Russian assets to Ukraine’s reconstruction and other needs, U.S. State Secretary Antony Blinken said earlier. 
The outlines of decisions necessary to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine are already being prepared, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at the time. 
Bill No. 8038 on the transfer of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on April 20. The bill still needs to be approved by the U.S. Senate. 
Ukraine could receive nearly eight billion dollars as part of this procedure. 
The ambassadors of the EU countries generally agreed on the transfer of revenues from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine on May 8. 
The U.S. intends to use seized Russian assets to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine, Blinken said on May 14 during his visit to Kyiv.

2024-05-17 10:02:00,resolutions by the annual general meeting of municipality finance plc held on 17 may 2024," Municipality Finance Plc 
Stock exchange release 
17 May 2024 at 1:00 pm (EEST) 
Resolutions by the Annual General Meeting of Municipality Finance Plc held on 17 May 2024 
The Annual General Meeting (hereinafter the AGM) of Municipality Finance Plc (MuniFin) held on 17 May 2024 adopted the company’s financial statements and discharged the members of the Board of Directors (the Board), the CEO, and the Deputy to the CEO from liability for the financial year 2023. 
Use of Profit Shown on the Balance Sheet and the Distribution of Dividend 
The Annual General Meeting decided that a dividend of EUR 1.69 per share, totalling 66,017,818.62 EUR shall be paid out. Dividends will be paid on 28 May 2024 or as soon as possible thereafter to each shareholder who is registered in the company’s shareholder register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record date of dividend payment on 21 May 2024. 
Remuneration and Composition of the Board 
The AGM decided on the remuneration for the members of the Board for the term from the closing of the 2024 AGM, to the closing of the next AGM (the Term 2024–2025) as follows: 
 * annual fixed remuneration of a Board member EUR 25,000; 
 * annual fixed remuneration of the Vice Chair of the Board EUR 29,000; 
 * annual fixed remuneration of the Chair of the Risk or Audit Committee EUR 31,000; 
 * annual fixed remuneration of the Chair of the Board EUR 45,000; and 
 * for each Board and committee meeting as well as for each meeting required by the authorities, to the members, a fee of EUR 600 per meeting attended and to the chairs, EUR 950 per meeting attended. 
  
  
The annual remuneration of the Chair of the Board was increased by EUR 3.000, the annual remuneration of the Vice Chair of the Board and the Chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees was increased by EUR 1.500 and the annual remuneration of a Board members was increased by EUR 1.000.

In addition, the AGM decided to elect Ms. Elina Stråhlman as a new board member. 
The CEO’s Review 
Esa Kallio, the President and CEO of MuniFin, discussed the development of the company in 2023, stating that it was the fourth consecutive year marked by instability. The increasing geopolitical tensions and market fluctuations did not significantly affect the operational capacity of MuniFin. MuniFin was able to, without disruption, fulfill its core mission of securing cost-effective long-term financing for its customers. Regarding the long-term financing of wellbeing services counties, the CEO emphasized that this is constrained by the annual limit of EUR 400 million set by the Municipal Guarantee Board, because wellbeing services counties are not members of the Municipal Guarantee Board. From the perspective of the development of public sector financing costs, it would be important for wellbeing services counties to become members of the Municipal Guarantee Board and thereby share the guarantee responsibility for the funding used in wellbeing services counties. Finally, for 2024, the CEO also stated that MuniFin has decided to terminate the business operations related to the advisory services provided by its subsidiary Rahoituksen neuvontapalvelut Inspira Oy, as the related business acquisition with FCG Finnish Consulting Group Oy fell through. 
Election and Remuneration of the Auditor 
PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy was elected as the company’s auditor with Jukka Paunonen, Authorized Public Accountant, as the principal auditor. The auditor’s fees will be paid against the invoices approved by the company. 
Constitutive Meeting of the Board 
At its constitutive meeting, the Board appointed Kari Laukkanen as the Chair and Maaria Eriksson as the Vice Chair of the Board. The following persons were appointed to the Remuneration Committee: Kari Laukkanen as the Chair, and Leena Vainiomäki and Maaria Eriksson as members. The following persons were appointed to the Audit Committee: Markku Koponen as the Chair, and Tuomo Mäkinen, Elina Stråhlman and Denis Strandell as members. The following persons were appointed to the Risk Committee: Leena Vainiomäki as the Chair, and Maaria Eriksson, Kari Laukkanen and Arto Vuojolainen as members.

Embedded Finance industry in Brazil is expected to grow by 37.3% on annual basis to reach US$ 4.31 billion in 2024. The embedded finance industry is expected to grow steadily over the forecast period, recording a CAGR of 26.2% during 2024-2029. The embedded finance revenues in the country will increase from US$ 4.31 billion in 2024 to reach US$ 13.82 billion by 2029. 
Brazil has witnessed a rapid increase in digitalization, driven by the growing adoption of smartphones and internet connectivity. With over 134 million smartphone users and approximately 149 million internet users as of 2021, there is a vast market for embedded finance solutions. The proliferation of digital channels provides a conducive environment for the expansion of embedded finance offerings. 
The substantial growth the embedded insurance space has experienced in Brazil can be primarily attributed to the growing number of insurtech firms emerging in the country. The number of insurtech firms has reached more than 200 in 2020, from less than 100 in 2,017. The rising popularity of embedded insurance policies is pushing Brazilian start-ups to leverage this rapid growth by raising funds. 
Capital infusion in the embedded insurance sector is projected to support the country’s overall insurance penetration rate.Growth Driver in Brazil: Brazil boasts a high smartphone penetration rate, creating a fertile ground for mobile-based embedded finance solutions. The number of smartphone users in Brazil surpassed 155 million in 2023, indicating a vast market for digital financial services. 
Expanding Fintech Ecosystem: Brazil’s fintech ecosystem has been rapidly expanding, with a surge in the number of startups offering innovative financial products and services. According to Statista, Brazil ranked third globally in terms of the number of fintech startups in 2020, with over 1,100 active companies. This vibrant ecosystem fosters competition and drives the development of embedded finance solutions tailored to the needs of Brazilian consumers and businesses. 
Financial Inclusion Initiatives: Despite advancements in digital banking, a significant portion of Brazil’s population remains underserved by traditional financial institutions. Embedded finance has the potential to bridge this gap by providing inclusive and accessible financial services to underserved communities. By leveraging technologies such as mobile banking and digital wallets, embedded finance solutions can reach unbanked and underbanked populations, driving financial inclusion efforts in the country. 
Major Innovation and Partnership in Brazil: 
Market players are increasingly combining their expertise and developing new embedded payments solutions to capture the massive untapped population in Brazil. 
In Jul 2023, Card issuer Marqeta entered Latin America’s largest FinTech market with its expansion into Brazil. The expansion is happening via a partnership with Latin American banking-as-a-service (BaaS) platform Fitbank and network certification with Visa. The expansion means Marqeta’s platform is operational in more than 40 counties, according to the release. With Fitbank, Marqeta’s customers get access to a platform licensed by Brazil’s central bank and directly integrated with PIX, the country’s real-time payments system. 
In February 2022, VEF invested USD 12.2 Mn in Gringo, Brazil’s leading ’super-app’ for driver, serving over 5 Mn drivers. VEF led Gringo’s USD 34 Mn Series B round with co-investment from Piton Capital, ICU, and participation from existing investors Kaszek, GFC and OneVC. 
Looking ahead, the Brazilian embedded finance market is poised for continued expansion, driven by various above listed factors and the increasing demand for convenient and accessible financial services.

2024-05-17 11:30:18,voters prefer trump over biden on economy. this data shows why," (Bloomberg) -- Americans give Donald Trump the edge over Joe Biden on the economy in poll after poll. 
Most Read from Bloomberg 
That’s even as the Biden years have been the best time to find work since the 1960s, and the US has bounced back from the pandemic with stronger growth than international peers such as the EU, UK and Japan and stronger growth overall than under President Trump. 
Instead, voters this year are focused on the steep jump in prices from the post-pandemic surge in inflation. 
In the April Bloomberg/Morning Consult swing-state poll, respondents said by 51% to 32% they were doing better financially under Trump than Biden. Out of 15 economic issues, the cost of everyday goods was far and away the top concern of registered voters in the poll. 
Covid, of course, powerfully shaped outcomes under both administrations. Trump took office in the midst of a well-established economic expansion, then hit a global pandemic. Biden had to deal with the aftermath.Economic data show the kitchen-table realities behind Americans’ judgment on the two presidents’ performance. The headline numbers don’t capture how income gains were distributed. Nor do they forecast the long-term impact of either president’s policies.Biden-Harris campaign spokesman James Singer said the president “is leading a great American comeback out of the mess of failure Donald Trump left behind.” He said under Biden the country outperformed a prediction by Bloomberg Economics — and many other financial market forecasters — that Federal Reserve interest-rate increases would trigger a recession. He called Bloomberg’s selection of indicators “flawed,” pointing instead to 15 million new jobs created since Biden took office. The Trump campaign argued job losses during the pandemic should be discounted. Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Trump, if re-elected, would “reimplement his America First, pro-growth, pro-job agenda and uplift all Americans.” Voters’ experience of the economy begins with their spending power. 
Real disposable personal income per capita — money available to spend after taxes and adjusted for inflation — is a clear measure of standard of living. Under Biden, it’s improved, but on average only at about a quarter the pace set during the Trump years. 
Trump fueled the economy with much more deficit-financed stimulus than Biden, enacting a $1.9 trillion, 10-year tax cut skewed toward wealthier households even before the pandemic economic crisis. 
The former president pumped in another $3.5 trillion for stimulus checks and other pandemic relief, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates. That pushed up Americans’ incomes even though pandemic lockdowns crashed the economy and drove up unemployment.Trump’s tax cuts and pandemic relief compare to $2.2 trillion of net relief under Biden, according to the committee’s estimates. The two presidents’ successive rounds of stimulus sent federal debt soaring. 
Still, Biden-era inflation resulted in disposable income growth that’s on track to be one of the worst of any post-World War II presidency. 
The cumulative increase in consumer prices during Biden’s term likely will end up being higher than any other president in the past 40 years. By comparison, inflation under Trump generally ran around the Federal Reserve’s 2% target and ended his term even lower. 
Trump came into office with inflation at 2.5% in 2017, and the pandemic economic crash brought the rate down to almost zero. Annual inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 as the economy re-opened. The rate has since fallen but was still a stubbornly high 3.4% in April. 
Republicans blame the pandemic-relief bill Biden signed in March 2021 and other federal spending. But stimulus checks were also distributed during Trump’s presidency, and tax cuts were enacted. The joint effect of pandemic-era relief programs under both presidents likely played a role in generating inflation when the economy reopened.Supply-chain constraints when the country roared back to life were an additional — and significant — catalyst. 
Biden’s projected average 4.1% unemployment rate would be the lowest for any modern president except for Lyndon Johnson’s 1965-1969 term. 
The jobless rate soared from 3.6% at the end of 2019 to 14.8% in April 2020 as the pandemic raged before falling to 6.4% in the month Trump left office. It continued falling under Biden as the economy recovered. 
The Democratic president can boast of a jobless rate below 4% for more than two years, the longest stretch of such low unemployment in more than half a century. 
The sustained period of strong employment opportunities has especially benefitted groups that historically had a hard time getting work, such as racial and ethnic minorities and the disabled. African-American unemployment rates hit the lowest level on record under Biden, though they also dropped to a decades-long low under Trump shortly before the pandemic.More mothers who have children under 18 at home now have jobs than ever recorded in data going back to 2009, likely helped by the strong labor market and employers’ post-pandemic acceptance of remote and hybrid work arrangements. 
Stocks have surged under both presidents. As of Wednesday’s market close, the cumulative increase in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index under Biden is slightly ahead of gains at the same point in Trump’s presidency. 
Stocks finished strong under Trump, with the S&P gaining a cumulative 68% while he was in the White House. That included a roller-coaster pandemic crash followed by a breath-taking rally fueled by government stimulus and Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. 
Trump’s tax cuts slashed the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, pumping up company profits and consequently their stock prices. Interest rates were also low and inflation remained under 3% during Trump’s presidency, helping buoy equities. 
Under Biden, stocks have been on a tear recently despite higher interest rates. Strong overall economic growth has boosted corporate profits while artificial intelligence advances fed excitement about improving productivity. The market also has benefited from outsized growth of the “Magnificent Seven” US technology companies. 
It’s gotten much harder to afford a new home under Biden, largely because the Fed’s campaign of interest-rate increases to fight inflation has driven up mortgage rates. 
Even so, average mortgage rates under Biden are lower than for any modern president before Barack Obama. 
But the very low mortgage rates during the pandemic have perversely made it harder to buy a new home now. Homeowners who refinanced with cheap mortgages are reluctant to sell, reducing the supply of homes on the market and keeping prices high. 
Overall economic growth has been stronger under Biden than Trump, powered by savings consumers had left over from hunkering down during the pandemic along with stimulus from Biden’s pandemic relief package. 
The US economy has outpaced global peers under Biden as it recovered from Covid, which produced wild swings in GDP in the final year of Trump’s presidency.

2024-05-17 12:34:40,“experience economy” may bolster post-covid downtown san jose recovery,"May 17, 2024 at 5:30 a.m.
| UPDATED:
May 17, 2024 at 5:34 a.m.
SAN JOSE — Unique experiences can pave a path for downtown San Jose to fully recover from its coronavirus-spawned economic maladies, in the view of the city’s mayor.
Mayor Matt Mahan offered the assessment Thursday evening while visiting a “block party” in the Fountain Alley section of downtown San Jose’s historic district.
San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan smiles while attending a block party in the Fountain Alley section of downtown San Jose’s historic district. 
“We are seeing a real rebound in downtown San Jose, and it’s being driven by what I like to call the experience economy,” Mayor Mahan said in an interview with this news organization during the block party event.
This week’s block party was the first of a series of such monthly events being held around the city’s urban core this spring, summer and fall to encourage economic activity in downtown San Jose.
A band plays while people gather for a block party in the Fountain Alley section of the historic district in downtown San Jose. 
Many office workers remain absent from San Jose’s urban core as well as many downtown districts nationwide and in the Bay Area, which has forced the South Bay’s largest city to scramble to find ways to replace that traditional source of economic activity.
“People are hungry for community, they want opportunities to gather face-to-face and enjoy unique experiences together,” Mahan said.
The balm for downtown San Jose’s lingering post-COVID afflictions might include experiences such as comedy clubs, live theaters, performance halls, restaurants, nightclubs and unique venues such as Urban Putt, a miniature golf outlet that has been open for a few months in the Paseo de San Antonio.
“Downtown is open for business,” San Jose City Councilmember Omar Torres, whose district includes the downtown, said during the block party event.
The Urban Vibrancy Institute is organizing block parties in different neighborhoods of downtown San Jose. The first one was Thursday night in Fountain Alley within San Jose’s Historic District along South First Street, East Santa Clara Street, South Second Street and East San Fernando Street.
“This event is going to help 65 businesses here in the Historic District,” Gary Dillabough, a partner with real estate firm Urban Community and an active developer in downtown San Jose, said during the block party.
Other block parties are slated to occur each month with events in the SoFA district, San Pedro Square, Paseo de San Antonio, Little Italy, and wrapping up at City Hall.
“This is a strategic investment towards economic growth when we hold these events,” said Leah Toeniskoetter, president and chief executive officer of the San Jose Chamber of Commerce.
The Urban Vibrancy Institute and San Jose political and business leaders hope that safety, cleanliness and more engaging activities and venues will be the keys to success in the downtown in the absence of many office workers.
Plus, it’s also possible that heightened economic activity in downtown San Jose might also help to improve safety in the urban core.

2024-05-17 12:54:12,estonia vetoes eu vat proposals for sharing economy services,"Estonia / EU: Estonia has vetoed plans to introduce value-added tax [VAT] on
sharing economy services such as Airbnb and Bolt in the European Union at a
meeting with finance ministers in Brussels.

The EU wants to digitalise invoicing for VAT and force platform services to
register to pay the levy, thereby modernising the tax process for the digital
economy and ensure that platforms pay their fair share of taxes across the bloc.
According to Euronews, the proposals, which were first put forward in 2022,
could potentially increase the cost of short-term renting or ride-sharing by up
to 25 per cent.

Under EU tax rules, any one of the 27 member states is allowed to block new
laws, but all member states must find a unanimous agreement in order to change
them.

The Baltic nation of Estonia, where the ride-sharing app Bolt was first founded
in 2013, was the only country to veto the proposed law.

Its finance minister, Mart Võrklaev, told his counterparts at the Brussels
meeting that the tax was not on platforms but on small- and medium-sized
enterprises [SMEs] that provide services on a platform, and shared concerns that
it would make consumers pay higher prices for booking sharing economy services
online. He further added that it would make it harder for platforms to reclaim
input taxes and that they would face “unfair” competition with direct sales.

Under new regulations that are coming into force in the EU this year, online
platforms are legally required to share information with tax authorities.
However, Võrklaev is rejecting the directive because it would be heavily
restrictive on the platforms and many of the businesses fall below the €40,000
annual turnover threshold, meaning that they should not need to pay VAT, a view
which is shared by Bolt.

It is believed that Estonia has no objections to the other two parts of the
package, including digital reporting and VAT registration in one place.

EU tax commissioner Paolo Gentiloni denied Võrklaev’s suggestions, saying that
the proposals would ensure the “necessary flexibility” for SMEs by enabling
national authorities to tailor their approach in each EU member state.

In the case of VAT, Brussels officials are becoming increasingly concerned that
online platform services are not paying enough in taxes in member states where
they have little physical presence, while lobbyists for hotels, which already
charge VAT [charged on the sale of goods and services], have denounced the
perceived unfair competition for their services from digital rivals.

As well as wider tax reforms, the proposals are also designed to modernise
invoicing and strengthen reporting rules in order to fight fraud.

Last December, Airbnb agreed to pay €576 million [$621 million] to the tax
office in Italy [Agenzia delle Entrate] after settling a long-running dispute
with the authority.

It came a month after a judge in Milan ordered the seizure of €779.5 million
[$831.6 million] from Airbnb’s European headquarters in Ireland over a probe
into alleged tax evasion. At the time, prosecutors alleged that the home-sharing
firm had failed to collect a mandatory 21 per cent of landlords’ rental income
[the income is said to have come in at around €3.7 billion] and pay it to the
Italian tax authorities, as per a 2017 law in the country.

In addition, three unnamed people who served in managerial roles at Airbnb
between 2017 and 2021, the period during which the violation was alleged to have
taken place, were placed under investigation.

Meanwhile, Booking Holdings has been designated as a gatekeeper for its online
intermediation service Booking.com under the EU’s Digital Markets Act [DMA] this
week, which will require the company to offer more choice and freedom to end
users within the next six months.

The DMA aims to ensure contestable and fair markets in the digital sector by
regulating gatekeepers [large digital platforms providing a gateway between
business users and consumers whose position can grant them the power to act as
bottlenecks in the digital economy]. Alphabet [the parent company of Google],
Amazon, Apple, ByteDance [[the parent company of TikTok], Meta [the parent
company of Facebook] and Microsoft were all designated as gatekeepers by the
European Commission last September.

Vincent Van Peteghem, the Belgian finance minister, wants his fellow ministers
to come to an agreement by the end of June but insisted that he would not back
down to Estonian demands to make the tax proposals optional.

WALWORTH, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2024--
Mecum Financial Services (MFS) celebrated its fifth successful year of providing competitive loans to Mecum customers at Dana Mecum’s 37th Original Spring Classic. Held this May 10-18 at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, the Indy 2024 auction featured the presentation of a ceremonial check showing more than $150 million—the amount that MFS has thus far helped Mecum customers secure for the purchase of their dream vehicles.

Mecum Auctions launched the MFS lending program five years ago at Dana Mecum’s 33rd Original Spring Classic auction in Indianapolis and has since facilitated more than 3,368 individual loan transactions for the purchase of classic and collector automobiles sold at Mecum events. The success of the program inspired the recent ceremonial check presentation at this year’s Indy auction, with MFS Director Lee Giannone taking to the stage to hand the check for $153,163,470 to Mecum Auctions Founder and President Dana Mecum.
”From the beginning, we recognized an underserved market niche that, if delivered and serviced effectively, would provide value to both Mecum Auctions and our customers,” said Giannone. ”Five years later, the number of transactions and total loan volume is evidence of the value that we’re providing to new and current customers to purchase the collector car of their dreams.”
MFS was developed to expand the end-to-end Mecum collector car services to include financing in addition to buying, selling and transporting, making Mecum auctions a convenient one-stop-shop for buyers and sellers alike. Unlike traditional after-purchase bank or credit union financing, which is often not offered for older classic cars, the MFS program is centered around the unique requirements of financing collector cars and motorcycles in an auction setting. MFS offers competitive rates and a simplified application process that can be completed in as few as three minutes.

Comment
Image Credits: Ember
A few years ago, you couldn’t go to a fintech meetup without ending up in a conversation about embedded finance. In 2020, we even wrote that embedded finance might represent fintech’s future .
The distribution strategy lets fintech companies integrate their services into other products and services, which in turn gives users access to new features without having to sign up to a new service. It’s proven an especially attractive approach for fintechs as it gives them a new layer of products to offer to bigger banks and financial services providers.
Ember , a British startup working on an embedded tax offering, is proving that the strategy is still a valid one in 2024. The small company has partnered with HSBC in the U.K. so that the bank’s business customers can access Ember’s services from their online accounts. Ember could potentially gain 400,000 customers with a single partnership.
Ember’s service fetches companies’ recent banking transactions and automatically categorizes them. After that, customers can track expenses, add receipts, create invoices and do basic accounting.
Ember then provides an overview of your company’s revenue and expenditure, estimates how much you’re going to pay in taxes, and tells you how much money is available to withdraw as dividends for the owners.
Image Credits: Ember
Bigger companies will likely work with chartered accountants directly or even hire in-house accountants. But freelancers and small companies with less than 10 employees could at least simplify their accounting processes with Ember’s self-serve product.
“The likes of Xero, QuickBooks, FreeAgent are all built for accountants and not end business owners. And we saw a huge opportunity to build a transformative experience for an end business owner to look after their entire suite of tax obligations,” Ember’s co-founder and COO, Daniel Hogan, told TechCrunch.
However, the issue is that this market is extremely fragmented. There are hundreds of thousands of small companies in the U.K. alone, meaning that it’s hard to get customers.
“We were going up against the likes of Xero and QuickBooks on advertising spend, and that was tricky to acquire customers directly because of that exact reason — it was expensive,” Hogan said.
That’s why Ember has started negotiating with big banks like HSBC UK to offer an embedded solution . HSBC pays Ember for each of its customers who chooses to use Ember’s features, and if they want to access more features, such as the ability to add other bank accounts from other financial institutions, they can pay Ember to do that.
Ember also has a team of in-house accountants who can take care of complex tasks for paid customers, such as end-of-year annual accounting and corporation tax management. Ember’s free-to-use version that you get on HSBC’s online banking portal acts as the top of the funnel for the startup to acquire paying clients.
Ember isn’t going to work exclusively with HSBC going forward. Contracts with big banks take a long time to negotiate, but hopefully the company will have another partner bank to announce soon.
With upcoming regulatory changes in the U.K. (“making tax digital”), accounting software will likely receive increased interest from small businesses. By 2026, around 1.75 million business owners in the country will have to change the way they file their taxes. The vast majority of them don’t use any accounting service to help them with this process.
“[The bank] has essentially made the decision to be an API-first organisation. So rather than building it themselves, they’re relying on the software providers, such as ourselves, to actually build all of that experience. They’re just being the API layer,” Hogan said.
“They’re relying on us to build better user experiences to help customers report both more frequently as well as more accurately.”
In addition to this initial partnership with HSBC, the regulatory opportunity is also part of the reason why Ember recently raised a £5 million funding round ($6.3 million at today’s exchange rate) from Valar Ventures, Viola Fintech and Shapers.

2024-05-17 13:34:00,the gig economy vs. america’s workers,"Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and other gig corporations have proposed several ballot initiatives in Massachusetts that would classify drivers and delivery people as independent contractors rather than employees. If they pass, these firms would have legal standing to continue depriving workers of basic employment rights and benefits. WASHINGTON, DC – Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, and other gig corporations are once again seeking the law’s blessing in the United States for their unscrupulous employment practices. Ahead of November’s election, these firms have proposed several ballot initiatives in Massachusetts that would empower them to classify drivers and delivery people as independent contractors rather than employees. (The Open Markets Institute, where I work, filed an amicus brief supporting a challenge to the constitutionality of the ballot questions.) As with Proposition 22 in California in 2020, Uber and other companies will probably spend lavishly to convince voters that these measures would benefit the affected workers and the public alike. 
If Massachusetts voters endorse the ballot initiatives in November, these firms would have the freedom to rob workers of basic employment rights and benefits, including minimum wages, overtime pay, workers’ compensation, and unemployment insurance. It would also give gig employers a major – and manifestly unfair – competitive advantage over rivals and drive down labor-market standards. Instead of encouraging this exploitative business model, state and federal policymakers should force these companies to comply with the laws that apply to all employers. 
Gig companies have misclassified their main workforce from the beginning, openly violating the law or exploiting its ambiguities. Uber and Lyft, for example, have insisted to regulators and the public that their drivers are independent contractors and thus not entitled to the rights and protections of employees, including the freedom to organize. These companies retain the control of an employer – Uber tells its drivers who to pick up and what routes to take, and sets their fares – while renouncing the responsibilities and costs of being one. 
The ballot initiative process could lift the legal cloud hanging over gig corporations – at least in Massachusetts, where they appear to be in violation of pro-worker employment laws. In 2020, then-Attorney General Maura Healey (who is now the state’s governor) sued Uber and Lyft, alleging that they misclassified drivers as independent contractors and illegally denied them the minimum wage and overtime pay. Proceedings in the case have just begun. 
Codifying the classification of gig companies’ drivers, shoppers, and delivery people as independent contractors would cause substantial harm. For starters, gig workers would be formally stripped of employment rights. Despite being misclassified, they can currently pursue legal recourse under Massachusetts law for nonpayment of the state’s $15 minimum hourly wage. Moreover, gig workers would not be entitled to unemployment insurance if they lost their job, or compensation if injured or attacked while on the clock. 
These are not merely theoretical harms. Many, if not most, Uber and Lyft drivers make less than the applicable minimum wage after factoring in the costs of their vehicle, gas, and insurance. Many gig workers lost their livelihood during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cab and delivery drivers are frequently attacked or injured on the job. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, transportation and delivery is the most dangerous line of work in the US, with 1,620 fatalities in 2022. Depriving gig workers of basic protections would have severe consequences for a group made up disproportionately of immigrants and people of color. 
What gig companies are seeking in Massachusetts and elsewhere is a permanent competitive advantage over rivals that must comply with the state’s employment laws. Firms that misclassify workers as independent contractors, and thus shirk their responsibilities as employers, save an estimated 20-40% on labor costs. Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash already possess this advantage. Rivals required to classify their workers as employees would still need to pay their workers a livable wage and contribute to the state social safety net. Taxicab companies that employ drivers and restaurants and supermarkets that deliver food have already lost substantial market share to gig companies that have long violated employment laws and were able to operate at a loss for years on end. The proposed ballot initiatives would legalize this unfair competition. 
The injustice is clear: a restaurant that employs a driver to deliver meals would be obligated to pay them at least $15 per hour, while DoorDash, delivering the same food from the same restaurant, could legally pay its driver less. When Congress enacted the national minimum wage and overtime law in 1938, it called payment of sub-living wages to workers “an unfair method of competition.” 
Lastly, if successful, the proposed ballot initiatives would unleash a race to the bottom. Over time, gig companies would capture even more market share through their harmful labor practices, and employ more workers who lack fundamental protections. Their rivals would face the choice of complying with the law and potentially going out of business, or engaging in practices such as wage theft to remain competitive. Though ostensibly narrow in scope, these measures could ultimately undermine Massachusetts’s strong labor-market standards. 
The proposed ballot initiatives represent an insidious effort on the part of gig corporations to legalize their unlawful business models. While a defeat at the ballot box – or in court – could force these companies to change tack in Massachusetts, that will not be enough. State and federal policymakers must take stronger action against these companies, which have largely succeeded by violating the rules enacted by elected officials. They have moved fast and broken things, and now seek after-the-fact validation for the damage they have caused. The government should say enough is enough: no one, including Uber, is above the law.",0.01855912
2024-05-17 13:45:00,energy-to-transport disparity heralds unprecedented chance to unlock growth: africa finance corporation (afc) state of africa’s infrastructure report," Study calls for urgent reassessment of outmoded pit-to-port models and uses new metrics to respond to full scale of continent’s infrastructure opportunity 
LAGOS, NIGERIA / ACCESSWIRE / May 17, 2024 / Africa has an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate development by aligning its abundant renewable energy resources with solutions for its infrastructure deficiencies. This is a key conclusion from a new annual study on the State of Africa’s Infrastructure initiated by the Africa Finance Corporation (www.AfricaFC.org). 
The report highlights critical gaps in key sectors including power, transport, logistics, digital communications, and commodity-based value chains. It aims to quantify the extent of Africa’s infrastructure opportunities and provide strategic guidance for prioritizing investments essential for sustainable growth. 
Among the key findings: despite decades of progress, Africa’s infrastructure development has not kept up with the growing needs of its population. The continent’s dependence on outdated pit-to-port models is hindering economic growth. However, global economic shifts in supply chains and the transition to green energy present an opportunity for Africa to redefine its economic role by leveraging its rich raw materials and youthful population. 
For Africa to capitalise on this pivotal moment, decisive and urgent action is required to develop the infrastructure and value chains that will enable industrialisation and climate-adaptive development. 
Focusing on energy access as a cornerstone to development, the report highlights the disparity in access to electricity as the most significant barrier to industrial growth. For this reason, progress in the crucial area of energy access should be measured not just by reductions in household energy poverty, but also by the capacity to provide sustainable energy solutions that support industrial and economic development. The potential for growth by bridging Africa’s energy deficit is illustrated using new metrics such as the Modern Energy Minimum, and application to the processing needs for commodities like bauxite and copper. 
Taking Guinea as a case study, the report observes that despite possessing the world’s largest bauxite reserves and being a top producer, Guinea cannot fully capitalize on its resources without receiving significant investments to boost its energy systems and processing facilities. By contrast, Australia, with similar bauxite volumes, extracts more than twice the economic value thanks to advanced refining and smelting capacities supported by a robust natural gas-powered energy infrastructure. This disparity underscores the urgent need for West Africa to develop robust energy systems and processing infrastructure. Investments in cross-border electricity and gas networks, leveraging existing ECOWAS treaties, could enable the region to build new industrial supply chains and move beyond raw material extraction. 
Coordinating transport and logistics networks is crucial to reducing high transportation costs, which currently inflate the price of goods by up to 40%. Significant investments in port infrastructure need to be matched by improvements in connecting road and rail networks. The report identifies opportunities to support trade corridors with new cross-border rail and road networks and to expand cargo handling at airports. 
”This report is not just about identifying challenges; it’s about unlocking the immense potential that lies within our collective resolve,” said AFC President & CEO Samaila Zubairu. ”The State of Africa’s Infrastructure Report is a call to action for stakeholders across the continent to collaborate for a smarter, more targeted, and better coordinated investment approach.”

2024-05-17 15:00:00,lili launches accountant ai for small businesses in managing finances,"Lili, the financial platform designed for small business owners, today announced
the launch of a new generative AI tool —Accountant AI— which harnesses
businesses’ financial data and the latest industry information to provide
business owners with personalized, instant recommendations about their
businesses’ finances.

Business owners, particularly those running smaller-sized operations, often
manage their own finances with no outside help, such as an accountant or
bookkeeper. Not only is this approach time-intensive, but it can also put
businesses at risk of costly mistakes. With Accountant AI, small business owners
will now have access to an AI-powered business advisor at their fingerprints,
enabling them to make more informed business decisions and become more
profitable.

“Nearly eighty percent of business owners handle their own accounting and
finances, which can be a heavy burden to bear on top of managing all the
day-to-day operations of a business,” said Lilac Bar David, co-founder and Chief
Executive Officer of Lili. “Accountant AI will revolutionize the way business
owners interact with their financial data by providing them with quick and more
affordable answers to all of their accounting and financial questions. For
business owners who cannot afford an accountant or more expensive accounting
tools, Accountant AI is a game changer.”

Accountant AI responds to queries using its extensive training and the latest
tax and accounting information, but unlike other AI chatbots on the market, it
generates insights from both the owner’s business and similar businesses on
Lili’s platform, makes recommendations based on the latest tax policy updates
and leverages human accounting expertise. Lili also partnered with Amazon
Bedrock to ensure Accountant AI has robust privacy and security measures to keep
businesses’ data safe from potential leaks or misuse.

Accountant AI is the next generation ofLili AI, the first AI accountant designed
specifically for small business owners, which launched last August. The first
phase of Lili AI introduced predictive transaction categorization for Lili’s
smart bookkeeping, helping business owners spend less time manually classifying
transactions for their taxes.

2024-05-16 17:34:04,‘banks continue to become increasingly less relevant’: the professor who sees a $2 trillion hole in the economy predicts a thinning of the herd," Fortune· Rebecca Greenfield—Fortune 
Silicon Valley Bank’s failure in March 2023 was a watershed moment for the banking sector. The $210 billion collapse was the third-biggest in American history, sending shockwaves throughout the industry and exposing the solvency issues created by rising interest rates. 
Columbia finance professor Tomasz Piskorski is one of the leading experts in surveying the post-SVB landscape, as one of the co-authors of a widely read 2023 study estimating a $2 trillion decline in banks’ asset values after the monetary tightening of the previous year. At the Fortune Future of Finance conference in New York City, Piskorski said the long-term consequence of higher-for-longer interest rates and new regulations will mean banks becoming less central to the financial system, as private credit and nonbank mortgage lenders such as Rocket Mortgage pick up the slack. 
“Banks continue to become increasingly less relevant, especially smaller-to-mid-sized banks,” Piskorski, Columbia’s Edward S. Gordon Professor of Real Estate, said Thursday. “Because of consolidation in the banking industry, I predict that in two years, we’ll have much fewer smaller-to-mid-size banks.” 
Banks are being forced to confront new risks post-pandemic, as tight Fed monetary policy devalues many of their loans and real estate holdings. They’re also contending with a string of bank failures that have exposed how quickly a seemingly stable bank can go under. Last March, Santa Clara-based SVB collapsed virtually overnight after depositors withdrew $175.4 billion in deposits in a matter of days. 
SVB’s clients started pulling their deposits after concerns circulated relating to losses the bank sustained on its long-term Treasury holdings, which went underwater after the Fed started hiking interest rates—so-called “duration risk.” SVB simply couldn’t handle the speed of the bank run, requiring the FDIC to step in and repay depositors: A new problem banks are being forced to contend with. 
“Regulations we have around liquidity were written before a time that you could move millions of dollars from a tiny device in your hand while on the subway,” Adrienne Harris, Superintendent of New York State’s Department of Financial Services, the state’s financial regulator, said. “You see 20% of deposits leave an institution in four hours. We’ve never seen anything like that before.” 
Bank runs aside, the macro conditions that led to last year’s bank failures haven’t gone away—Piskorski said there are likely many banks facing the same hidden solvency issues as SVB. 
“There are quite a few banks in the United States right now that have very similar risk characteristics [to SVB],” Piskorski said. “[They] have the market value of their assets being less than the face value of their debt…In principle, if the depositors show up, there’s bank runs—unless, of course, regulators step in.” 
Commercial real estate has emerged as a key area of concern for banks and regulators. Office buildings’ values have plunged post-pandemic as the rise of remote work has decreased demand for in-person desk space, leaving many banks on the hook for expensive real estate loans they signed a decade ago. They’re being forced to kick the can down the road by refinancing at high rates, sell their properties for pennies on the dollar, or default. 
Midsize banks are especially exposed—they hold around 40% of their assets in CRE loans, according to Piskorski. That overweight exposure has already generated banking flare-ups, such as New York Community Bank’s emergency bailout in March. 
“In general, the banking sector is very stable. Federal regulators did a wonderful job last spring…to contain the contagion that we’ve started to see across the banking sector from SVB and then to Signature [Bank], but there are still risks in the sector at large,” Harris said. “A lot of regulators, federal and state, are watching commercial real estate very closely.” 
Piskorski predicts that as struggling CRE portfolios and duration risks continue to weigh heavily on the banking sector, industry-wide tightening is on the horizon, potentially in the form of consolidation—and new, more nimble forms of lending will pick up the slack. New regulations potentially mandating higher capital requirements will also force smaller banks to tighten their belts, cutting down on their margins and creating opportunities for private credit or nonbank lenders such as Rocket Mortgage. 
“If the regulators decide to crack down, we’ll see further contraction of smaller and mid-size banks,” Piskorski said. “We’ll see growing [market share for] debt securities and private credit.”

Francis Ford Coppola Slams Studio System After He Self-Financed ‘Megalopolis’: Execs ‘Don’t Make Good Movies … They Pay Their Debt Obligations’
By

Francis Ford Coppola shared his thoughts on the current studio system during the Cannes Film Festival press conference for his self-financed epic “ Megalopolis ,” saying that they might not be around much longer.
“I fear that the film industry has become more of a matter of people being hired to meet their debt obligations because the studios are in great, great debt. And the job is not so much to make good movies, the job is to make sure they pay their debt obligations,” Coppola said in response to a question from Variety. “Obviously, new companies like Amazon and Apple and Microsoft, they have plenty of money, so it might be that the studios we knew for so long, some wonderful ones, are not to be here in the future anymore.”
The presser also veered into the political, with Coppola being asked if the film is a commentary on Donald Trump, prompting him to share his thoughts on the current state of U.S. politics.
Popular on Variety
“Men like Donald Trump are not at the moment in charge, but there is a trend happening in the world toward the more neo-right, even fascist tradition, which is frightening because anyone who was alive during World War II saw the horrors that took place and we don’t want a repeat of that,” Coppola said. “So again, I think it’s the role of the artist, the films, to shine light on what’s happening in the world.”
“Jon, you have different political opinions,” Coppola then said in a moment that drew laughs from journalists. Voight responded, “How did you find that out?”
Coppola continued, “If I may say, one of the things about our wonderful cast is that they reflect all sorts of political ideas. This is not one notion.”
The sci-fi epic divided the Cannes audience at its premiere on Thursday night, earning a seven-minute standing ovation but also sparking plenty of discourse about its slew of shocking scenes , including a deepfake sex tape featuring Adam Driver, Shia LaBeouf playing a Trumpian figure who sometimes dresses in drag and Aubrey Plaza’s evil dominatrix.
LaBeouf, whose performance played the biggest in the theater during the film’s premiere, was conspicuously absent from Friday’s press conference. Beyond Coppola, cast and crew in attendance included Driver, Plaza, Nathalie Emmanuel, Giancarlo Esposito, Laurence Fishburne, Voight, Coppola’s granddaughter Romy Mars, Talia Shire, producer Roman Coppola and cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr.
Reviews of “Megalopolis” were mixed, with Variety chief film critic Peter Debruge writing that the film “is positively awe-inspiring in some places and an absolute eyesore in others, until you pull back and try to take it all in.”
Coppola has been trying to make “Megalopolis” for decades, eventually using $120 million of his own money from his wine empire to produce the film. Controversy surrounded the film in the lead-up to its premiere, as its expense and reportedly muted responses to early screenings have made it difficult to secure distribution.
A Guardian report also alleged chaos on set , including Coppola’s behavior toward women, which allegedly including trying to kiss extras to “get them in the mood” for a nightclub scene. Coppola did not respond to the claims, but executive co-producer Darren Demetre defended the director in a statement to the Guardian, saying that Coppola did kiss some extras on the cheek in a friendly manner but no one ever expressed to him that Coppola’s behavior made them uncomfortable.
“Megalopolis” marks the 85-year-old director’s first film in over a decade, since 2011’s “Twixt.” It follows architect Cesar Catilina (Driver), who after an accident destroys a New York City-esque metropolis, works to rebuild it as a sustainable utopia. Corrupt mayor Franklyn Cicero (Esposito) challenges Cesar and wants to stick to the status quo, but his daughter Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel) comes between the two men.

2024-05-17 18:48:21,putin’s finance minister forced to take the bus during china visit: ’no space’," Accompanying Russian President Vladimir Putin on an official state visit to China this week, a top Kremlin official was bumped from the presidential motorcade to a bus full of journalists due to a lack of space. 
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was forced to ride with the reporters who accompanied Putin and his delegation as they traveled through Beijing during a high-profile official visit. 
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov took a bus full of journalists on his way to a concert in Beijing, China. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov took a bus full of journalists on his way to a concert in Beijing, China. Telegram: @zarubinreporter 
”On large visits that are so difficult from the point of view of organization, anything can happen,” said Pavel Aleksandrovich Zarubin, one of the pro-Kremlin reporters who rode with the minister, in a video post shared on his Telegram account. While some reporters described the experience as a ”surprise,” Zarubin said that Siluanov ”didn’t care.” 
Siluanov took the bus to a concert featuring Chinese and Russian musicians, which showcased traditional instruments such as China’s erhu and Russia’s bayan. The concert kicked off a cultural exchange program between the two countries that will run through next year. 
The event was a key part of the diplomatic visit aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership between China and Russia. 
Putin’s two-day visit concluded on Friday. Speaking to reporters ahead of his departure, Putin praised his discussions with China President Xi Jinping as ”substantive,” noting that he spent ”almost a whole day, from morning till evening” with the Chinese leader and other officials. 
”The partnership between China and Russia is not directed against anyone,” Putin said in a veiled reference to the West. ”It is aimed at one thing: creating better conditions for the development of our countries and improving the well-being of the people of China and the Russian Federation.” 
Both Russia and China frequently emphasize the concept of an ”emerging multipolar world” as a counterbalance to what they see as U.S. dominance in global affairs. 
”It is important that those who are trying to maintain their monopoly on decision-making in the world on all issues do everything in their power to ensure that this process goes naturally,” he added. 
Washington has warned Beijing cannot ”have its cake and eat it too” by seeking to strengthen ties in Europe and the West while also embracing Moscow, the ”biggest threat to European security in a long time.” 
The diplomatic trip, Putin’s first international visit since he was inaugurated for a fifth term earlier this month, came amid the third year of a grinding war in Ukraine, where Russia has been making advances on the battlefield after a stalled offensive. 
Joseph Torigian, a research fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institute, told the Associated Press the visit between Putin and Xi was meant to send a message to the U.S. and its allies: ”At this moment, they’re reminding the West that they can be defiant when they want to.”",0.13626999

The world's oldest cryptocurrency caught a bid on Monday as traders awaited the key inflation report slated to come later in the week. BTC rose ~8% and crossed the $66K mark on Wednesday after soft reports on consumer inflation and retail sales bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve could commence interest-rate cuts sooner this year. The cryptocurrency then continued to trade in a narrow range of $64.6K-$66.7K for the rest of the week. ""The market has seen a swift pickup of Bitcoin price to $66K after the CPI data was lower than expected. The market rallied as this is seen as a possible bullish shift,"" -Lucy Hu, senior analyst, Metalpha said. The U.S. Consumer Price Index eased on a monthly basis in April, while the retail sales, flatlined from a month before after downwardly revised increases in the previous two months. ""Global investors should continue paying attention to other macro indicators in the coming months,"" Hu added. ""After CPI data showed that inflation had cooled in April, the market is now attributing greater probability to the Fed easing monetary policy this year. As a result, asset prices across the board rallied, including equities and Bitcoin,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin financial services firm. Notable News Coinbase Global ( COIN ) closed lower on Thursday following a media report that CME Group ( CME ) is planning to start Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) trading in hopes of profiting from the increasing demand from money managers to add exposure to crypto.

2024-05-17 10:58:26,blackrock’s rieder says fed rate cut would tame inflation by tamping down services demand,"BlackRock’s head of global fixed income says the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to cool inflation as that would dampen demand in the services side of the world’s largest economy. With benchmark rates lingering at their highest in more than two decades, affluent Americans are earning the most they have in years from fixed-income investments, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said on Bloomberg’s “Wall Street Week” program . “People who are middle to higher income are now getting a big benefit from these interest rates, and those are the people that spend, on aggregate, on services,” he said. “Because goods prices have come down so much, it's allowing for disposable income to go into services. That's actually buoying prices in services,” Rieder said. The “price of a pair of tennis shoes is what it was 20 years ago. If you go to a tennis match, it's double what it used to be,” he said. Rieder said the Fed holding interest rates high is a “huge benefit” to people 55 years and older who have been saving money. “They're turning around and spending,” he said. Inflation is sticky in health and auto insurance and other services, Rieder said. “They're unresponsive to interest rates and older people, middle to high income, are spending and are keeping that service level inflation at high levels.” Rieder's interview aired after the April inflation report release this week showed some moderation in prices, sending Treasury yields ( US10Y )( US2Y ) lower on ramped-up expectations for the Fed to start cutting rates this year. “The worst fears were allayed,” by the April data, with prices for transportation services and rent coming down “encouraging,” he said.

2024-05-17 09:35:00,"4 stocks to watch on friday: amat, hood and more","U.S. stocks on Friday opened mixed , with markets largely continuing their pullback from a record-breaking session on Wednesday driven by latest consumer inflation data. Here are some stocks to watch on Friday: Shares of Applied Materials ( AMAT ) rose more than 1% in early trade. They had initially dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the largest U.S. semiconductor equipment maker reported FQ2 2024 results. Applied Materials' ( AMAT ) revenue was flat Y/Y. Its Dynamic Random Access Memory business constituted about 32% of FQ2 sales, up from 11% a year ago. Meanwhile, its foundry, logic and other unit comprised about 65% of total revenue, down from 84% a year ago. Applied Materials ( AMAT ) also provided current quarter revenue guidance that came in above estimates. Several Wall Street brokerages boosted their price target on the stock on Friday. See how AMAT performed in charts . Copart ( CPRT ) stock gained marginally after the opening bell. The company, which conducts online vehicle auctions for car sellers, delivered FQ3 2024 profit that came in-line with expectations, while its revenue rose nearly 11% Y/Y to $1.13B. Copart ( CPRT ) top boss Jeff Liaw noted that in the quarter, the company observed a 14% decline in the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, which pointed to a continued fall in vehicle values. ""As anticipated, new and used vehicle prices have decreased somewhat steeply in recent days, while repair costs remain elevated, driving a strong and continued recovery in total loss frequency,"" Liaw said on the earnings conference call . Class A shares of Snowflake ( SNOW ) fell nearly 2% in early trade. The data warehousing company is in talks to acquire Reka AI for more than $1B, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Reka is an artificial intelligence model startup founded by former researchers from Alphabet's ( GOOG )( GOOGL ) DeepMind. Reka last June reportedly raised $50M in a fundraising round that valued it at $300M. That fundraising had also included a contribution from Snowflake's ( SNOW ) venture arm. Class A shares of Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ) advanced more than 4% after the start of regular trading. Bank of America issued a rare double-upgrade on the stock to Buy from Underperform. The brokerage believes that the ""current entry point"" into the cryptocurrency trading platform is much more positive than when it initiated the stock with an Underperform rating back in 2021 after its market debut.
