2024-05-03 15:27:28,"Bitcoin bounces back after soft jobs report, crossing $60K threshold","Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rebounded Friday after a soft U.S. jobs report alleviated worries about higher-for-longer interest rates. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap ( BTC-USD ) jumped 4% to $61.7K at 3:27 p.m. ET, compared with the $59.1K mark it changed hands at just minutes before the April nonfarms payroll report arrived. The U.S. economy added 175K jobs in April , less than the 243K expected and a slower pace than the 315K notched in March (revised from 303K), according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The latest tally marks the smallest payroll growth of 2024, with the largest being 315K in March. Wage growth also cooled last month, potentially giving the Federal Reserve the confidence to ease rates later this year. Ether ( ETH-USD ), the world's largest altcoin, too, saw buying pressure on the back of the cooler-than-expected jobs data, advancing 2.2% to $3.06K at the time of writing. Note the crypto-price gains coincided with a strong stock-market rally, with all three major U.S. indices rising at least 1%. ""It's intriguing to note that Bitcoin rose by 5% following the NFP miss,"" Althea Spinozzi, head of Fixed Income Strategy at Saxo, said in an X post. ""Clearly, the data weren’t weak enough to trigger a broad selloff in risky assets; instead, they had the opposite effect. As long as markets see a soft landing & inflation is sticky, yields are likely to rise.""

2024-05-03 15:24:23,Bitcoin falls 3.2% on a weekly basis as Fed keeps interest rate unchanged,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to post a weekly fall of 3.2% , in a week that saw the Federal Reserve strike a surprisingly more dovish tone while leaving rates unchanged. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) started the month on a disappointing note, as it fell to its lowest level seen in more than two months, and slid to $56.6K, before the Fed's decision came in on Wednesday. BTC, however, pared its losses on the day and rose back to the $58K mark, after the Fed decided to ease its quantitative tightening by slowing the pace of its balance sheet runoff, and held the rates steady for its sixth consecutive meeting. Chair Jerome Powell also ruled out rate hikes as the next likely move. The cryptocurrency has been steady since then, and stayed near the $58K mark. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price has rebounded after the Federal Reserve tapered its QT program, which will serve to boost liquidity in the markets, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin digital financial services firm, Cory Klippsten said. ""BTC is sitting above $60,000 and large capital allocators haven’t even arrived to the party yet. This, along the Fed returning to more accommodative policies, has investors bullish on Bitcoin’s future prospects,"" Klippsten added. The largest cryptocurrency has also been witnessing a sell-off, while the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ((ETFs)) have seen outflows. Retail investors selling off cryptocurrencies alongside other headwinds is keeping J.P. Morgan cautious toward the market . On Thursday, U.S. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs witnessed its largest daily outflow since last August, as investors pulled $564M from 11 Bitcoin ETFs, the biggest pullout since the ETFs debuted in January. ""BTC-USD has shown a negative reaction following the recent halving event, contrary to historical trends,"" said SA analyst Income Generator, adding he expects BTC's short term trend to be downward, but long-term is more favorable. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has dropped ~9% since the halving event took place on April 20. ""Most of the evidence appears to be centered in the positive direction, and this means that recent declines in BTC-USD could unveil new buying opportunities relatively soon,"" Income Generator added. Another SA analyst, Knox Ridley , also remained optimistic and said, ""Both technical and on-chain analysis support higher levels for Bitcoin, and as long as any further weakness holds $42,750, we view this dip as a buying opportunity.""

2024-05-03 10:23:16,"Bonds are in an early secular bear market, stocks in a late secular bull market - analyst","BofA Strategist Michael Hartnett said that bonds are in an “early secular bear market” that is driven by inflation. This is due to “fiscal excess, debt, war, deglobalization,” he wrote in a BofA “The Flow Show” report. The 30-year U.S. Treasury ( US30Y ) was down 40% during the past four years. The secular bear “is only over once electorates on Main St. (via elections) and Wall St. (via debt ratings, and failed auctions) vote for less fiscal excess,” he said. ( TBT ) ( TLT ) ( SHY ) ( IEI ) ( IEF ) Commodities, however, are in an “early secular bull market.” Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) has outperformed stocks ( SP500 ), ( COMP:IND ), ( DJI ) since the U.S-China trade war began in 2018. ( GLD ) ( USO ) ( PDBC ) Stocks, on the other hand, are “in late secular bull market” with no change in U.S. leadership -- namely, top tech stocks -- since 2019, and no recession to change leadership plus valuation, Hartnett said. ( SPY ) ( IVV ) ( VOO ) ( IWM ) ( IWR ) ( MDY ) According to him, this would end with a bubble and/or with a recession. Lastly, he said the U.S. dollar, is in a “secular bear market,” especially compared to cryptocurrencies ( BTC-USD ), ( ETH-USD ), ( BNB-USD ) and gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ). “U.S. debt/deficits require weaker FX to attract foreign capital and/or Fed support for Treasury via rate cuts,” he said, adding that the U.S. dollar cyclical bull on U.S. exceptionalism is driven by “exceptionally easy fiscal policy.” More on United States 30-Year Bond Yield: Weekly Forecast, April 19, 2024: Higher For 30 Years?

Morgan cautious on crypto with retreat by retail investors, dearth of upside drivers","Retail investors selling off cryptocurrencies alongside other headwinds is keeping J.P. Morgan cautious toward the market. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) finished sharply lower in April, sinking 15% for the first monthly loss since August 2023. It traded close to $59,000 on Thursday, much lower than its all-time high above $73,000 in March. “The past two weeks saw significant selling/profit taking with perhaps retail investors playing a bigger role than institutional investors,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Thursday note. Spot bitcoin ETFs logged outflows in April and retail investors appeared to have sold both crypto and equity assets during last month’s trade, the firm said. Panigirtzoglou also said the market is facing a trio of headwinds consisting of elevated positioning, high bitcoin prices compared with gold as well as estimated bitcoin production costs, and subdued crypto funding by venture capitalists. “In all, with a lack of positive catalysts, with the retail impulse dissipating and with the three headwinds mentioned … still in place, we maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets over the near term,” Panigirtzoglou said. In terms of institutional investors, J.P. Morgan said it’s mostly momentum traders such as Commodity Trading Advisors or other quantitative funds taking profit on previous extreme long positions in bitcoin as well as in gold. Some bitcoin ETFs to watch are Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ).
