Prisma Finance $11.6M hacker claims it was a ‘whitehat rescue’
The hacker’s on-chain message came approximately six hours after the hack occurred. However, blockchain security firms noted the hacker had also started swapping the stolen funds for Ether.

The hacker behind the $11.6 million exploit of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Prisma Finance is claiming it was a “whitehat rescue” and is enquiring about returning the funds, according to on-chain messages.
“Hi, this is a whitehat rescue, who can I contact to refund,” the exploiter said on March 28, around 6 hours after the attack. The message came from the address “0x2d4…7507a” — which was earlier identified as being one of three addresses linked to the attack.
“Please contact us at negotiations@prismafinance.com,” the DeFi firm said in response about two hours later.
On-chain messages were sent between Prisma Finance and the hacker. Source: Etherscan
A white hat hacker refers to a person who uses their hacking ability to find security vulnerabilities in software code. In the broader cybersecurity world, these security experts often notify the creator of the attack vector rather than exploiting it themselves.
However, in the cryptocurrency industry, it is more common for hackers to exploit the protocol and then ask for a white hat bounty in exchange for immunity, though there have also been cases where they’ve returned funds without asking for any reward.
The first batch of malicious transactions occurred at 11:29 am UTC on March 28. Prisma Finance is still investigating the root cause of the attack.
Blockchain security firm PeckShield estimated about $11.6 million was stolen and sent to three separate addresses.
The hacker then started swapping the stolen funds to Ether (ETH), according to blockchain security firm Cyvers.
Prisma Finance engineers have since halted the DeFi protocol."

2024-03-29 03:45:38,"OBAMA, CLINTON ON WHY AMERICANS DON’T LOVE THE BIDEN ECONOMY"," By Jeff Mason 
NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton dug into an issue that has vexed economists, political strategists and the White House on Thursday - if the U.S.’s fiscal numbers are so good, why are Americans so unhappy about the economy? 
Speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser for President Joe Biden at New York’s Radio City Music Hall, Obama and Clinton urged thousands there to stick with the Democratic president for a second term, while trying to pin down the reasons economic concerns are high despite job growth, healthy spending and better-than-expected GDP increases. 
There are ”structural problems” that frustrate people, Obama said, including the suppression of unions. That’s something Biden has specifically battled against, he said. 
”If you’re working hard, and your paycheck is getting stretched, beyond the breaking point, and you’re worried about rent, and you’re concerned about the price of gas, it’s understandable,” Obama said. 
The thing Biden and the people who support him need to communicate is: ”Who do you think is actually going to look out for you?” Obama said. He made clear he did not think former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, would meet that test. 
Trump and Republicans have blamed Biden for high prices that hurt American pocketbooks in grocery stores, the housing market and other sectors of the economy. Biden has pointed to company profit-taking, lack of competition and argued that inflation is coming down but there is still more work to do. 
Clinton, who was president from 1993 until 2001, seemed to compare the current situation to the run-up to the 2016 election that his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, lost to Trump. 
The 2008 financial crisis marred and limited what Obama could accomplish, Clinton said. Biden, at the time Obama’s vice president, did a ”heck of a good job” running the 2009 Recovery Act then, Clinton said, as they worked to fill a $3 trillion hole in the economy. But at the end of Obama’s term, people couldn’t fully feel the economic progress yet. They did later. 
”President Trump, let’s be honest, had a pretty good couple of years ‘cause he stole them from Barack Obama,” Clinton said about the economy Trump inherited from his predecessor. 
”I listened to him tell us how terrible the American economy was all during 2016 and then by January 2017, after the inauguration, it had become wonderful, miraculously, overnight.” 
The country should not make the mistake of 2016 again, Clinton said. (Reporting by Jeff Mason; Writing by Heather Timmons; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)"

2024-03-29 09:42:04,Poll: Many Americans Say Immigrants Contribute to Economy," FILE - Cars and trucks line up to enter the US from Mexico at a border crossing in El Paso, Texas, March 29, 2019. 
Americans are more worried about legal immigrants committing crimes in the U.S. than they were a few years ago, a change driven largely by increased concern among Republicans, while Democrats continue to see a broad range of benefits from immigration, a new poll shows. 
The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that substantial shares of U.S. adults believe that immigrants contribute to the country’s economic growth and offer important contributions to American culture. But when it comes to legal immigrants, U.S. adults see fewer major benefits than they did in the past, and more major risks. 
About 4 in 10 Americans say that when immigrants come to the U.S. legally, it’s a major benefit for American companies to get the expertise of skilled workers in fields like science and technology. A similar share (38%) also say that legal immigrants contribute a major benefit by enriching American culture and values. 
Both those figures were down compared with 2017, when 59% of Americans said skilled immigrant workers who enter the country legally were a major benefit, and half said legal immigrants contribute a major benefit by enriching American culture. 
Meanwhile, the share of Americans who say that there’s a major risk that legal immigrants will commit crimes in the U.S. has increased, going from 19% in 2017 to 32% in the new poll. 
FILE - A migrant child seeking asylum kneels in front of a member of the Texas National Guard and asks to be allowed to enter the United States, as seen from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Jan. 30, 2024. 
Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say that immigration is an important issue for them personally, and 41% now say it’s a major risk that legal immigrants will commit crimes in the U.S., up from 20% in 2017. Overall, Republicans are more likely to see major risks — and fewer benefits — from immigrants who enter the country legally and illegally, although they tend to be most concerned about people who come to the country illegally. 
Bob Saunders is a 64-year-old independent from Voorhees, New Jersey. He disapproves of President Joe Biden’s performance when it comes to immigration and border security and is particularly worried about the number of immigrants coming to the southern border who are eventually released into the country. He stressed that there’s a difference between legal and illegal immigration. Saunders said it’s important to know the background of the immigrants coming to the U.S. and said legal immigration contributes to the economy. He also noted the immigrants in his own family. 
”It’s not anti-immigration,” Saunders said. ”It’s anti-illegal immigration.” 
Many Republicans, 71%, say there’s a risk of people in the country illegally coming to the U.S. and committing crimes, although many studies have found immigrants are less drawn to violent crime than native-born citizens. Even more, 80%, think there’s a major risk that people in the country without permission will burden public service programs, while about 6 in 10 Republicans are concerned that there’s a major risk of them taking American jobs, that their population growth will weaken American identity or that they will vote illegally — although only a small number of noncitizen voters have been uncovered. 
Amber Pierce, a 43-year-old Republican from Milam, Texas, says she understands that a lot of migrants are seeking a better life for their children, but she’s also concerned migrants will become a drain on government services. 
”I believe that a lot of them come over here and get free health care and take away from the people who have worked here and are citizens,” Pierce said. ”They get a free ride. I don’t think that’s fair.” 
Democrats, on the other hand, are more likely to see benefits from immigration, although the poll did find that only half of Democrats now think that legal immigrants are making important contributions to American companies, a decrease of more than 20 percentage points from 2017. But they’re more likely than Republicans to say that the ability of people to come from other places in the world to escape violence or find economic opportunities is extremely or very important to the U.S’s identity as a nation. 
”People who are coming, are coming for good reason. It’s how many of us got here,” said Amy Wozniak, a Democrat from Greenwood, Indiana. Wozniak said previous waves of immigrants came from European countries. Now immigrants are coming from different countries but that doesn’t mean they’re not fleeing for justifiable reasons, she said: ”They’re not all drugs and thugs.” 
There’s also a divide among partisans about the value of diversity, with 83% of Democrats saying that the country’s diverse population makes it at least moderately stronger, compared with 43% of Republicans and Independents. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say that a shared American culture and set of values is extremely or very important to the United States’ identity as a nation, although about half of Democrats also see this as important. 
FILE - Migrants who crossed the Rio Grande and entered the US from Mexico line up for processing by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Sept. 23, 2023, in Eagle Pass, Texas. 
U.S. adults — and especially Republicans — are more likely to say that the country has been significantly changed by immigrants in the past five years than they are to say that immigrants have changed their own community or their state. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults say immigrants have had a major impact on their local community while about 6 in 10 say they’ve had a major impact on the country as a whole. The gap between perceptions of community impact and effects on the country as a whole is particularly wide among Republicans. 
There is some bipartisan agreement about how immigration at the border between the U.S. and Mexico should be addressed. The most popular option asked about is hiring more Border Patrol agents, which is supported by about 8 in 10 Republicans and about half of Democrats. Hiring more immigration judges and court personnel is also favored among majorities of both parties. 
About half of Americans support reducing the number of immigrants who are allowed to seek asylum in the U.S. when they arrive at the border, but there’s a much bigger partisan divide there, with more Republicans than Democrats favoring this strategy. Building a wall — former President Donald Trump’s signature policy goal — is the least popular and most polarizing option of the four asked about. About 4 in 10 favor building a wall, including 77% of Republicans but just 12% of Democrats. 
Donna Lyon is a Democratic-leaning independent from Cortland, New York. She believes a border wall would do little to stop migrants. But she supports hiring more Border Patrol agents and more immigration court judges to deal with the growing backlog of immigration court cases: ”That would stop all the backup that we have.” 
Congress just recently approved money to hire about 2,000 more Border Patrol agents but so far this year, there’s been no significant boost for funding for more immigration judges. Many on both sides of the aisle have said it takes much too long to decide asylum cases, meaning migrants stay in the country for years waiting for a decision, but the parties have failed to find consensus on how to address the issue. 
The poll of 1,282 adults was conducted March 21-25, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

2024-03-29 11:10:52,Prisma Finance Hacker Moves Funds to Tornado Cash,"The recent movement of $2.6 million to TornadoCash by the Prisma Finance hacker
has sent shockwaves through the DeFi community. This significant transfer comes
amidst ongoing developments following the exploit that rocked Prisma Finance.
Prisma Finance was hit by an exploit that targeted individual vaults, prompting
an emergency response from the platform. Blockchain security firm PeckShield 
flagged suspicious on-chain activity on March 28 with various investigations
showing the total assets drained hit $11.6 million about 3,257 ETH.

As a precautionary measure, Prisma Protocol was paused by the emergency
multisig, ensuring the safety of remaining funds. Despite the attack, Prisma
Finance took swift action to reassure users that stablecoins like mkUSD and
ULTRA remained overcollateralized and secure. However, the incident resulted in
a substantial decrease in the total value locked in the protocol, dropping from
approximately $220 million to $115 million.

CLAIM OF “WHITEHAT RESCUE” AND RECENT TRANSACTIONS
The individual behind the exploit at Prisma Finance has purportedly claimed it
was a “whitehat rescue” and expressed intentions to return the funds. Messages
on the blockchain have surfaced, providing some support for this claim. However,
skepticism remains prevalent, with many questioning the legitimacy of the
purported rescue.

Recent blockchain activity as depicted by PeckSheildAlert reveals further
insight into the hacker’s actions. In the aftermath of the exploit, the hacker
responsible for the $11.6 million DeFi protocol breach made a series of
transactions. The hacker first transferred a significant sum of 757.69 ETH
valued at $2,702,091.47 to an initial address and a subsequent transaction of
740 ETH valued at $2,638,996.56 was transferred to an address associated with
Tornado Cash.



Notably, This series of transactions has added complexity to the ongoing
investigation and raised questions about the true motives behind the exploit.

CURRENT STATUS AND ANALYSIS
As of the latest update, Prisma Finance’s live price stands at $0.267253, with a
24-hour trading volume of $8.47M USD. However, the platform has experienced a
significant decline of -24.20% in the last 24 hours, reflecting the impact of
the recent events on investor sentiment.

The hacker’s movements have cast a shadow of uncertainty over Prisma Finance and
its community. The decrease in total value locked following the exploit, coupled
with the ongoing investigation and the hacker’s subsequent transactions, has
heightened concerns regarding the platform’s security and stability.

Shehbaz Sharif will lead the CCI, with all four chief ministers serving as members.
Copy URL
For the first time, the Foreign Minister has assumed the position typically held by the Finance Minister in the Council of Common Interests (CCI), as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sanctioned the restructuring of the council. Acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, President Asif Ali Zardari convened the eight-member council in accordance with Article 153 of the Constitution. Shehbaz Sharif will lead the CCI, with all four chief ministers serving as members. The recent notification also includes Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defense Minister Khawaja Asif, and Safron Minister Amir Muqam among the CCI’s members.
The CCI stands as the principal decision-making body in the nation, addressing disputes between the federal government and provinces, notably concerning the allocation of natural resources. This shift marks another instance where Prime Minister Shehbaz has chosen the Foreign Minister over the Finance Minister for a particular responsibility. Just last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz established six distinct cabinet committees focusing on economic coordination, energy, Chinese investment projects, privatization, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), and legislative matters.
In a significant decision, Prime Minister Shehbaz retained control of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) while assigning Foreign Minister Dar to lead the Cabinet Committee on Privatization, traditionally overseen by the finance minister. However, following public criticism, Shehbaz swiftly reorganized the ECC, appointing Finance Minister Aurangzeb as its head.
Finance minster to visit US
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is scheduled to visit Washington on April 14 and 15 for discussions with officials from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Addressing a gathering at the Karachi Stock Exchange, Aurangzeb emphasized the urgency of securing a new IMF program for Pakistan spanning at least three years. He highlighted the necessity of effective policies to tackle economic challenges and credited the recent IMF agreement to measures undertaken during the caretaker government’s tenure, contributing to economic stability.

Aurangzeb outlined plans for privatizing struggling enterprises like Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and improving airport operations, aiming to complete PIA’s privatization by June. Additionally, efforts are underway to reduce circular debt and enhance exports. The board of directors of PIA recently approved the government’s privatization plan, expected to yield $250-300 million, aligning with Pakistan’s pursuit of a new IMF loan program.

2024-03-29 16:45:28,How Uber and the gig economy changed the way we live and work,"How Uber and the gig economy changed the way we live and work
There’s a steep price to pay for convenience.
Fri, Mar 29, 2024, 5:45 PM
·6 min read
Koren Shadmi for Engadget
Gig work predates the internet. Besides traditional forms of self-employment, like plumbing, offers for ad-hoc services have long been found in the Yellow Pages and newspaper classified ads, and later Craigslist and Backpage which supplanted them. Low-cost broadband internet allowed for the proliferation of computer-based gig platforms like Mechanical Turk, Fiverr and Elance, which offered just about anyone some extra pocket change. But once smartphones took off, everywhere could be an office, and everything could be a gig — and thus the gig economy was born.
Maybe it was a confluence of technological advancement and broad financial anxiety from the 2008 recession, but prospects were bad, people needed money and many had no freedom to be picky about how. This was the same era in which the phrase ”the sharing economy” proliferated — at once sold as an antidote to overconsumption, but that freedom from ownership belied the more worrying commoditization of any skill or asset. Of all the companies to take advantage of this climate, none went further or have held on harder than Uber.
Uber became infamous for railroading its way into new markets without getting approval from regulators. It cemented its reputation as a corporate ne’er-do-well through a byzantine scandal to avoid regulatory scrutiny, several smaller ones over user privacy and minimally-beneficial surcharges as well as, in its infancy, an internal reputation for sexual harassment and discrimination . Early on, the company used its deep reserves of venture capital to subsidize its own rides, eating away at the traditional cab industry in a given market, only to eventually increase prices and try to minimize driver pay once it reached a dominant position. Those same reserves were spent aggressively recruiting drivers with signup bonuses and convincing them they could be their own boss.
Self-employment has a whiff of something liberatory, but Uber effectively turned a traditionally employee-based industry into one that was contractor-based. This meant that one of the first casualties of the ride-sharing boom were taxi medallions. For decades, cab drivers in many locales effectively saw these licenses as retirement plans, as they’d be able to sell them on to newcomers when it was time to hang up their flat cap. But in large part due to the influx of ride-sharing services, the value of medallions has plummeted over the last decade or so — in New York, for instance, the value of a medallion dropped from around $1 million in 2014 to $100,000 in 2021. That’s in tandem with a drop in earnings, leaving many struggling to pay off enormous loans they took out to buy a medallion.
Some jurisdictions have sought to offset that collapse in medallion value. Quebec pledged $250 million CAD in 2018 to compensate cab drivers . Other regulators, particularly in Australia, applied a per-ride fee to ride-sharing services as part of efforts to replace taxi licenses and compensate medallion holders . In each of those cases, taxpayers and riders, not rideshare companies, bore the brunt of the impact on medallion holders.
At first it was just cab drivers that were hurting, but over the years, compensation for this new class of non-employee app drivers dried up too. In 2017, Uber paid $20 million to settle allegations from the Federal Trade Commission that it used false promises about potential earnings to entice drivers to join its platform. Late last year, Uber and Lyft agreed to pay $328 million to New York drivers after the state conducted a wage theft investigation. The settlement also guaranteed a minimum hourly rate for drivers outside of New York City, where drivers were already subject to minimum rates under Taxi & Limousine Commission rules.
Many rideshare drivers have also sought recognition as employees rather than contractors, so they can have a consistent hourly wage, overtime pay and benefits — efforts that the likes of Uber and rival Lyft have been fighting against. In January, the Department of Labor issued a final rule that aims to make it more difficult for gig economy companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The EU is also weighing a provisional deal to reclassify millions of app workers as employees.
Of course, the partial erosion of an entire industry’s labor market wasn’t always the end goal. At one point, Uber wanted to zero out labor costs by getting rid of drivers entirely. It planned to do so by rolling out a fleet of self-driving vehicles and flying taxis.
”The reason Uber could be expensive is because you’re not just paying for the car — you’re paying for the other dude in the car,” former CEO Travis Kalanick said in 2014 , a day after Uber suggested drivers could make $90,000 per year on the platform. ”When there’s no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle. So the magic there is, you basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody, and then car ownership goes away.”
Uber’s grand automation plans didn’t work out as intended, however. The company, under current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, sold its self-driving car and flying taxi units in late 2020.
Uber’s success had second-order effects too: despite a business model best described as ”set money on fire until (fingers crossed!) a monopoly is established” a whole slew of startups were born, taking their cues from Uber or explicitly pitching themselves as ”Uber for X.” Sure, you might find a place to stay on Airbnb or Vrbo that’s nicer and less expensive than a hotel room. But studies have shown that such companies have harmed the affordability and availability of housing in some markets, as many landlords and real-estate developers opt for more profitable short-term rentals instead of offering units for long-term rentals or sale. Airbnb has faced plenty of other issues over the years, from a string of lawsuits to a mass shooting at a rental home .
Increasingly, this is becoming the blueprint. Goods and services are exchanged by third parties, facilitated by a semi-automated platform rather than a human being. The platform’s algorithm creates the thinnest veneer between choice and control for the workers who perform identical labor to the industry that platform came to replace, but that veneer allows the platform to avoid traditionally pesky things like legal liability and labor laws. Meanwhile, customers with fewer alternative options find themselves held captive by these once-cheap platforms that are now coming to collect their dues. Dazzled by the promise of innovation, regulators rolled over or signed a deal with the devil. It’s everyone else who’s paying the cost.
To celebrate Engadget’s 20th anniversary , we’re taking a look back at the products and services that have changed the industry since March 2, 2004.

PM Srettha: Legalise casinos to save Thailand’s economy
22 hours ago
 
Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin advocated for the legalisation of casinos to combat the shadowy underworld economy in Thailand.
 
PM Srettha outlined his vision for a new law permitting entertainment complexes housing legal casinos, aiming to drag illicit activities into the light and bolster national revenue streams.
 
“We have to bring the grey [underground] economy into the light to allow us to control it, both for security and suitability. And we can collect taxes properly. I agree with this and believe it’s an important issue.”
The Bangkok-born Thai prime minister articulated the potential of legal casinos to dissolve the nation’s pervasive illegal gambling dens while concurrently replenishing the treasury.
“If they can go to legal casinos, why will people continue breaking the law? Gamblers can try their luck at legal casinos.”
 
Addressing opposition, the 62 year old PM asserted the necessity of parliamentary deliberation, urging lawmakers to heed the voice of the populace. He called for an end to the hypocrisy surrounding gambling, advocating for stringent regulations to oversee its practice.
 
In his dual role as finance minister, the Thai prime minister acknowledged the prolonged timeline for implementing the proposed law, acknowledging the ongoing battle against illegal gambling. Labour Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn echoed the sentiment, foreseeing a surge in job opportunities with the establishment of legal casinos within entertainment complexes across Thailand, reported The Nation.
 
Phiphat anticipated the creation of up to 50,000 new jobs, underscoring the potential economic windfall and the prospect of quelling illegal gambling through legitimate means.
 
ORIGINAL STORY: Legalising casinos to boost economy: Thailand House of Representatives forms committee
 
A 60-member committee to probe into the potential launch of entertainment hubs, inclusive of casinos, has been established by Thailand’s House of Representatives. This move seeks to rectify the issue of underground casinos and invigorate the nation‘s financial state, as suggested in a proposal put forth by members of parliament from diverse parties.
The endorsers of the proposal encompassed Thoedchart Chaipong, a Pheu Thai MP for Chiang Rai; Non Paisanlimcharoenkij, a Move Forward Party MP for Nonthaburi; and Chatchawal Kong-udom, a United Thai Nation Party list-MP.
 
The process of establishing a committee to explore this matter was debated upon in a House session presided over by House Speaker Wan Muhamad Noor Matha.
 
Rangsiman Rome, a Move Forward Party list MP, conveyed his agreement, whilst cautioning that a parallel working group had also been set up by the preceding House of Representatives to scrutinise this issue.
 
The opposition MP disclosed that he was alerted about a Tak province-based firm, implicated in human trafficking and illicit human organs trading, that managed to send a representative to present its perspective before the committee, seemingly with harmful intent.
 
Rangsiman emphasised the requirement for preventative steps against ill-intent influence. He expressed his belief that legalising casinos could lead to the downfall of casinos operating at the borders, thereby redirecting the money of Thai gamblers towards the government revenue for national development.
 
United Thai Nation Party list-MP Chatchawal underscored the financial loss resulting from Thai citizens travelling to neighbouring countries for casino gambling. Chatchawal revealed that he had initially proposed the legalisation of casinos 30 years ago, but faced opposition, reported Bangkok Post.
 
He suggested situating at least five entertainment complexes with casinos strategically across the country — one each in the North, the South, the East, the West and the Central Plains. He affirmed that this would provide local employment opportunities, eliminating the need for some Thais to seek employment overseas.

Gambling is illegal in Thailand except for during a wedding or funeral. To allow casinos to open in Thailand they would need to change the laws to allow it. Thais already have a problem with household debt, gambling addictions, and borrowing money from high interest personal lenders. Their solution to allow casinos does not justify the problems it will create and will only benefit those who are invested in having the casinos. Perhaps instead they should stop wasting money trying to get legislation to allow the casinos and instead apply it to enforcing the current gambling laws. 
For crying out loud, they were plenty fast taking dart boards from bars due to their possibilities of being used for gambling.

The thing about this guy is that he appears intelligent but I really don’t think he is. What they don’t seem to get is that taxing people to death is not a solution, so if you reduce luxury taxes people will start buying luxury goods, if you reduce wine taxes people will start buying fine wine. They keep talking about it but I don’t see them doing it, it’s basic common sense. 
 
Thailand could have a very vibrant fine wine industry, the five star hotels could really benefit with major wine events, and the country could become a regional mecca (hub?) for wine afficionados. But they need to lower the tax to a reasonable rate (10 to 30% total, including local taxes and Vat) and then you’ve got an additional appeal for the wealthy tourists that they keep on talking about.

Mate, it’s time to stop treating Thais as children.
They will then start to grow up, just like many countries have done in the past.

2024-03-29 15:45:00,"Many Americans say immigrants contribute to economy but there’s worry over risks, AP-NORC poll finds","Laurel Highlands, Ringgold and Charleroi districts have seen an influx of immigrant students. Charleroi alone has welcomed 172 students from numerous countries. KDKA-TV’s Shelley Bortz reports.

People leave Mexico on March 13 to cross into the United States for their appointment with officials to seek asylum, seen from Tijuana, Mexico. WASHINGTON — Americans are more worried about legal immigrants committing crimes in the U.S. than they were a few years ago, a change driven largely by increased concern among Republicans, while Democrats continue to see a broad range of benefits from immigration, a new poll shows. 
The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that substantial shares of U.S. adults believe that immigrants contribute to the country’s economic growth, and offer important contributions to American culture. But when it comes to legal immigrants, U.S. adults see fewer major benefits than they did in the past, and more major risks. 
About 4 in 10 Americans say that when immigrants come to the U.S. legally, it’s a major benefit for American companies to get the expertise of skilled workers in fields like science and technology. A similar share (38%) also say that legal immigrants contribute a major benefit by enriching American culture and values. 
Both those figures were down compared with 2017, when 59% of Americans said skilled immigrant workers who enter the country legally were a major benefit, and half said legal immigrants contribute a major benefit by enriching American culture. 
Meanwhile, the share of Americans who say that there’s a major risk that legal immigrants will commit crimes in the U.S. has increased, going from 19% in 2017 to 32% in the new poll. 
Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say that immigration is an important issue for them, and 41% now say it’s a major risk that legal immigrants will commit crimes in the U.S., up from 20% in 2017. 
Overall, Republicans are more likely to believe in major risks — and fewer benefits — from immigrants who enter the country legally and illegally, although they tend to be most concerned about people who come to the country illegally. 
Bob Saunders is a 64-year-old independent from Voorhees, New Jersey. He disapproves of President Joe Biden’s performance when it comes to immigration and border security and is particularly worried about the number of immigrants coming to the southern border who are eventually released into the country. 
Saunders said it’s important to know the background of the immigrants coming to the U.S. and said legal immigration contributes to the economy. He also noted the immigrants in his own family. 
”It’s not anti-immigration,” Saunders said. ”It’s anti-illegal immigration.” 
Many Republicans, 71%, say there’s a risk of people in the country illegally coming to the U.S. and committing crimes, though studies found immigrants are less drawn to violent crime than native-born citizens. 
Even more, 80%, think there’s a major risk that people in the country without permission will burden public service programs, while about 6 in 10 Republicans are concerned that there’s a major risk of them taking American jobs, that their population growth will weaken American identity or that they will vote illegally — though only a small number of noncitizen voters have been uncovered. 
Amber Pierce, a 43-year-old Republican from Milam, Texas, says she understands that a lot of migrants are seeking a better life for their children, but she’s also concerned migrants will become a drain on government services. 
”I believe that a lot of them come over here and get free health care and take away from the people who have worked here and are citizens,” Pierce said. ”They get a free ride. I don’t think that’s fair.” 
Democrats, on the other hand, are more likely to see benefits from immigration, though the poll found only half of Democrats now think that legal immigrants are making important contributions to American companies, a decrease of more than 20 percentage points from 2017. 
They’re more likely than Republicans to say that the ability of people to come from other places in the world to escape violence or find economic opportunities is extremely or very important to the U.S’s identity as a nation. 
”People who are coming, are coming for good reason. It’s how many of us got here,” said Amy Wozniak, a Democrat from Greenwood, Indiana. Wozniak said previous waves of immigrants came from European countries. Now immigrants are coming from different countries but that doesn’t meant they’re not fleeing for justifiable reasons, she said: ”They’re not all drugs and thugs.” 
There’s also a divide among partisans about the value of diversity, with 83% of Democrats saying that the country’s diverse population makes it at least moderately stronger, compared with 43% of Republicans and Independents. 
Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say that a shared American culture and set of values is extremely or very important to the United States’ identity as a nation, though about half of Democrats also see this as important. 
U.S. adults — and especially Republicans — are more likely to say that the country has been significantly changed by immigrants in the past five years than they are to say that immigrants have changed their own community or their state. 
About 3 in 10 U.S. adults say immigrants have had a major impact on their local community while about 6 in 10 say they’ve had a major impact on the country as a whole. The gap between perceptions of community impact and effects on the country as a whole is particularly wide among Republicans."

2024-03-29 19:09:16,Powell: ‘No reason’ to think economy is close to recession," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that there is “no reason” to think the U.S. economy is close to a recession. 
“Growth is strong,” Powell said at a conference in San Francisco. “As I mentioned, the economy is in a good place. There is no reason to think the economy is in a recession or is at the edge of one.” 
The U.S. economy has largely defied expectations over the past year and a half, avoiding the recession that many economists were anticipating at the end of 2022. 
In what many experts have declared a “soft landing,” inflation has come down significantly without triggering a major economic downturn. After peaking at 9.1 percent in June 2022, one measure of inflation, the consumer price index (CPI), has since fallen to 3.2 percent. 
The labor market has also remained surprisingly resilient in the face of repeated interest rate hikes by the Fed as the central bank has attempted to tamp down inflation. 
The economy added 275,000 jobs in February while the unemployment rate sat at 3.9 percent, continuing the longest sub-4 percent streak since the late 1960s. 
At its latest meeting earlier this month, the Fed opted to hold its baseline interest rate steady once again at a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent, where it has remained since last summer. Powell has maintained that the central bank needs to see more “good” data before cutting rates. 
“Inflation has eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong. And that is very good news,” Powell said at a press conference last week. “But inflation is still too high. Ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured. And the path forward is uncertain.” 
A separate inflation gauge closely monitored by the Fed, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, showed a slight uptick last month, according to new data released Friday. 
Prices rose 0.3 percent over the previous month and 2.5 percent year-over-year in February, the data showed. 
However, Powell said Friday that the latest numbers were “pretty much in line with our expectations,” emphasizing that the Fed still expects inflation to gradually “come down on a sometimes bumpy path.”"

A’s pitcher Stripling had backup plan in personal finance before MLB career took off","March 29, 2024 at 1:36 p.m.
| UPDATED:
March 29, 2024 at 1:36 p.m.
MESA – Ten years ago, Ross Stripling was sitting at home unable to pitch, wondering if Tommy John elbow surgery had derailed his career.
Stripling, then 24, was a promising prospect fighting to earn a spot as the Los Angeles Dodgers’ No. 5 starter after coming off a season with a 2.82 earned run average in 127.2 innings between High-A and Double-A.
During that recovery time, Stripling, who is scheduled to start tonight for the Oakland A’s against the Cleveland Guardians, made strides toward a backup plan if his playing career didn’t pan out – working in personal finance.
The Texas A&M graduate with a degree in business finance did not originally plan to go down that route.
After growing up in Southlake, Texas, Stripling enrolled at A&M for its highly esteemed engineering program. After a while, he decided to switch gears and pursue a finance degree. He said he enjoyed the way finances looked toward the future instead of the past.
The initial interest came from his family. Through the years, Stripling slowly gained knowledge from both of his grandfathers who actively invested in the stock market.
“I just learned about it from talking to them and picking their brains,” he said. “I invested my own signing bonus (of $130,000) when I signed. Not that it was anything crazy, but that kind of got my feet wet with investing.”
It all came together when Stripling was sidelined for the 2014 season and started making progress toward securing his financial licenses.
“The guy that my mom’s dad invested with in Houston just kind of fielded a call from my grandfather saying, ‘Hey, my grandson has a lot of free time on his hands right now. He’s maybe looking for a fallback plan if baseball doesn’t work. Do you have anything for him?’’’ Stripling said.
“I didn’t know what to expect. I walk in, like all dressed up and have no idea what to expect, and he’s just like, ‘You know, the best thing I can do is probably get you licensed. You’d have to take your Series 7 (General Securities Representative Exam) and (Series) 66 (Uniform Combined State Law Exam) to make you a licensed money manager.’”
The plan was for Stripling to go back to baseball and, whether he was successful or not, build a network of potential clients.
Stripling, who arrived to the A’s in a February trade with the Giants, has followed through on that objective. From his debut in 2016 to the present day, Stripling has worked with a variety of people and still actively manages 11 accounts.
Of course, baseball has worked out well for Stripling, a former All-Star: He has earned nearly $36 million in his career and is the A’s top-earning player at $9.25 million (plus $3.25 million from the Giants).

What needs to go right for Oakland A’s to have successful season on the field in 2024
The issue of professional athlete money management is not new. Fifteen years ago, Sports Illustrated published a groundbreaking story that, through interviews with players, agents and others, reported 78 percent of former NFL players had gone bankrupt or were under financial stress within two years of retirement and 60 percent of NBA players were broke within five years of retirement.
And former major leaguer Jody Gerut estimates that 70 percent of foreign-born Latino players in MLB endure financial hardship within four years of retirement.
Stripling believes baseball players are generally pretty good with money. Those with large signing bonuses often seek professional advice right away, while lower-round picks look for instruction immediately on how to budget in order to survive.
In his eight years at the major league level, he has guided many of his teammates: Top-level pros may make large yearly sums, but most athletes have relatively short careers, so financial literacy is important.
“I’ve actively tried to make sure that people are aware that I have that skill set,” Stripling said. “I’ve definitely tried to make sure that there’s an open line of communication with me and a lot of guys pick my brain.”"

On March 27, U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla denied Coinbase’s bid to dismiss an SEC lawsuit, finding the SEC “sufficiently pleaded” Coinbase was unlicensed and its crypto staking offering was unregistered securities.
The judge also determined that the SEC failed to allege that Coinbase conducted brokerage activity through Coinbase Wallet, which is a self-custody crypto wallet app that gives users full control of their assets.

U.S. Sen. Mike Braun’s Senate campaign must pay a $159,000 civil penalty to the Federal Election Commission for violating campaign finance rules during the 2018 election. 
The FEC posted an agreement on the penalty this week. The Indianapolis Star first reported the penalty Friday. 
The FEC initially charged the Braun campaign with illegally accepting improper loans, but after the campaign provided documentation, the FEC determined the violation resulted from clerical errors by a former treasurer, Travis Kabrick.

2024-03-29 22:27:42,SING INVESTMENTS & FINANCE’S (SGX:S35) DIVIDEND IS BEING REDUCED TO SGD0.06," Sing Investments & Finance Limited (SGX:S35) is reducing its dividend from last year’s comparable payment to SGD0.06 on the 10th of May. The yield is still above the industry average at 5.9%. 
Check out our latest analysis for Sing Investments & Finance 
A big dividend yield for a few years doesn’t mean much if it can’t be sustained. Based on the last payment, Sing Investments & Finance was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business. 
Over the next year, EPS could expand by 6.7% if recent trends continue. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 42% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward. 
The company’s dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from SGD0.0333 total annually to SGD0.06. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.1% over that duration. We have seen cuts in the past, so while the growth looks promising we would be a little bit cautious about its track record. 
With a relatively unstable dividend, it’s even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Sing Investments & Finance has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.7% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing. 
Even though the dividend was cut this year, we think Sing Investments & Finance has the ability to make consistent payments in the future. While the payout ratios are a good sign, we are less enthusiastic about the company’s dividend record. The payment isn’t stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio. 
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For instance, we’ve picked out 1 warning sign for Sing Investments & Finance that investors should take into consideration.

2024-02-29 23:05:41,Brazil’s finance minister proposes global tax on the super-rich at G20 meeting in Sao Paulo," RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil’s finance minister told his peers Thursday at a G20 meeting in Sao Paulo that countries should implement a global tax on the super-rich in an effort to tackle rampant tax evasion. 
Fernando Haddad said tax evasion can be resolved through international cooperation so that “these few individuals make their contribution to our societies and to the planet’s sustainable development.” 
He added that Brazil is pushing for a declaration on international taxation by G20 members that he hopes would be ready in July. But in a press conference at the end of the meeting, he recognized the path would be far from smooth. 
“There will be a lot of debate about this, which is absolutely natural, especially because not every country feels the same way about this problem that was brought to the G20 by Brazil,” he said. 
Brazil currently has the presidency of the 20 leading rich and developing nations and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has put issues that concern the developing world – such as the reduction of inequalities and the reform of multilateral institutions — at the heart of its agenda. 
“Brazil has a role to play, a legitimacy to use on the issues that need to be addressed and that are not always represented in the G20,” Haddad said, pointing to environmental, social and fiscal issues. 
According to a 2023 study by advocacy group Tax Justice Network, countries around the world could lose up to $4.8 trillion in tax revenue over the next decade due to tax havens. And a report earlier this year by the EU Tax Observatory cited by Haddad, found that billionaires worldwide have effective tax rates equivalent of between 0% and 0.5% of their wealth. 
In recent years, scandals such as the Panama Papers Leak and the Paradise Papers have shone a light on the pervasiveness of tax evasion and avoidance in business practices. 
Meanwhile, the gap between the super-rich and the bulk of the global population has been supercharged since the coronavirus pandemic, according to anti-poverty organization Oxfam International. 
“There are fewer taxes on assets today than two or three decades ago. The global movement has tended towards reducing taxation on companies and wealth,” said André Vereta-Nahoum, a sociology professor at the University of Sao Paulo. 
But with inequalities soaring, more are calling for higher taxes on the wealthy – including U.S. President Joe Biden, who has pushed for a billionaire minimum income tax although the likelihood of Congress passing that proposal is minimal. 
In a sign of growing global consensus on the matter, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution late last year backing stronger international tax cooperation to “make it fully inclusive and more effective.” 
“The difficulty is no longer putting the issue on the table, the data is there. The difficulty is arriving at a common document,” said Carla Beni, an economist from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank.

Prime Capital Announces Scholarship Fund Encouraging Women to Work in Finance
The program aims to support diversity in the financial services industry.
Reported by
Natalie Lin
Prime Capital Investment Advisors LLC announced Wednesday the Future of Finance Scholarship Fund , supporting academic scholarships for young women interested in pursuing careers in finance.
The scholarships, already awarded to their first two recipients, are designed to encourage young women to consider a career in financial services, says Terra McBride, Prime Capital’s chief marketing officer. McBride highlights the importance of starting with education in the quest to create a more diverse talent pool from which the industry can draw, with the scholarships available to current high school and college students.
“We started talking about the pool of people who are out there,” McBride says. “We certainly want the most talented people working for our firm, and we do believe that recruiting talent and diversity are not mutually exclusive endeavors.”
The lack of female representation in financial advisement continues, according to the Carson Group’s “2023 State of Women in Wealth Management Report.” Released in November 2023, the report stated that the financial services industry has not made significant progress in gender diversity since the CFP Board first started tracking data a decade ago. Women made up 23.7% of CFP professionals in 2023, just barely up from 23.3% in 2020, according to the CFP Board website.
To encourage women to enter financial services, the Future of Finance Scholarship currently provides $5,000 for the academic year. Beyond the scholarship, recipients may also receive additional support from Prime Capital in the future.
“We’ve talked about including the people who are scholarship recipients as candidates for the Prime Capital internship program,” says McBride. “This will provide the young women with mentorship and real-world experience within the financial advisory field.”
Addressing the eligibility criteria, McBride says there is a focus on academic excellence, but emphasizes the importance of dedication to community service and a commitment to expanding financial literacy. The scholarship, available nationwide, has an application deadline for May 31 and requires essay, recommendation letters, high school transcript, and other materials.
The initial recipients for the 2023 to 2024 academic year included “two fantastic recipients that we’re really excited to see what they do in the near future with all of their learnings.” McBride says they are still working out how many recipients there will be for the coming school year.
When asked about the timing of the program’s launch, McBride acknowledged the industry’s overdue need for increased diversity.
“We really recognize that we’re kind of behind in terms of increasing diversity as an industry,” she says. “We wanted to get this going as fast as possible, because we want to start addressing this immediately.”
Looking ahead, McBride says the long-term vision includes expanding the scholarship to people of color, especially women of color. The scholarship application is currently open for the 2024 to 2025 academic year, with outreach efforts including announcements at industry events and targeted outreach to colleges and universities.

February 29, 2024 6:34 pm
by David Beard, The Dominion Post
MORGANTOWN – Following the death of the CROWN Act – SB 496 – on Wednesday, advocacy groups on Thursday presented a check for $5,500 to Black women-led West Virginia organizations Thursday in front of State Sen. Eric Tarr’s office.
The groups said in a press release that they raised the funds online in just under 48 hours.
The act narrowly passed out of Senate Judiciary last Thursday, only to be sent to Senate Finance last Friday. It was intended to prohibit discrimination based on race – under the state Human Rights Act – that includes discrimination based on hair textures and protective hairstyles historically associated with a particular race, where the term protective hairstyles includes braids, locks, and twists.
Tarr, R-Putnam, successfully moved to have the bill referred to his committee saying it carries significant fiscal implications, where it died without further action by the Crossover Day deadline.
Two of the bill’s three fiscal notes, he said, came back with “pretty extraordinary expenses associated with them. … We’re controlling expenses very tightly and this one would be a very large, one and there’s much smaller fiscal notes that haven’t made it through.”
The advocacy groups based their check on the fiscal note from the attorney general’s office. The note said any changes to law that result in more litigation where the AG’s Civil Rights Division represents the Human Rights Commission will add some costs to state government.
“This is an unavoidable consequence of any changes in law that require education and may result in litigation. As such, costs estimates cannot be considered zero. However, given the lack of any relevant data on this at present, it is unclear whether any litigation will actually arise from this bill and, more particularly, whether the attorney general’s office will bear measurable increases as a result.”
The note estimated an initial cost of $10,000 to implement with subsequent annual costs of $5,000.
At the check presentation, the Rev. Jenny Williams, a faith organizer who helped spearhead the fundraiser, said, “This is such needed legislation, so we’ve been puzzled as to why Senator Tarr is blocking it. If you want to help and protect people, you make it happen. Five thousand dollars is nothing in the scope of the state budget. We decided to show how easy it is to raise this money when you care about Black and brown people.”
The groups said the funds will be equally distributed among Black By God (the West Virginian), WV Black Pride Foundation, Black Voter Impact Initiative, and the Partnership for Furthering Arts and Education.

 * BRAZIL - Portuguese"," BARCELONA, Spanje, 29 februari 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ZTE Corporation (0763.HK / 000063.SZ), een wereldwijd toonaangevende leverancier van oplossingen op het gebied van informatie- en communicatietechnologie, kondigde  in samenwerking met Wuhan Iron and Steel Co.Ltd.  (WISCO) en  China Unicom, aan dat  hun gezamenlijke project  ”5G Fully Connected Smart Steel Factory”  als ”Best Mobile Innovation for Connected Economy” werd onderscheiden op de Global Mobile (GLOMO) Awards tijdens MWC Barcelona  2024.  De onderscheiding  is een erkenning  voor hun  indrukwekkende inspanningen  om de manier waarop mensen werken in fabrieken te veranderen en de werkplek te digitaliseren. 
Sinds 2020 hebben de gezamenlijke inspanningen van WISCO en zijn partners  geleid tot  de oprichting van het project ”5G Fully  Connected Smart Steel Factory”. Dit project is nu uitgegroeid tot  het grootste 5G-privénetwerk in de wereldwijde staalindustrie, met een indrukwekkende 5G-dekking van 99% binnen de fabrieksgebouwen. Door gebruik te maken van deze robuuste 5G-privénetwerkinfrastructuur heeft het project 25 staaltoepassingen geïmplementeerd in zes belangrijke scenario’s. Deze toepassingen omvatten slimme logistiek, productiecontrole, digitaal apparatuurbeheer, energie- en milieucontrole, kwaliteitscontrole en veiligheidsbeheer. Om de activiteiten te stroomlijnen, heeft de fabriek een controlecentrum op bedrijfsniveau opgericht, naast speciale operationele centra voor ijzerfabricage, staalfabricage, CSP en warmwalsen. Deze geïntegreerde aanpak  heeft de weg vrijgemaakt voor een naadloos, alles-in-één-klik staalproductieproces. 
Het 5G-privénetwerk is toegepast in het belangrijkste productiegebied van WISCO. Meer dan 100 bovenloopkranen hebben de onbemande reconstructie voltooid. Sinds de implementatie van slim transport van gesmolten ijzer is de transportefficiëntie voortdurend verbeterd. Met name de temperatuurdaling  van gesmolten ijzer  is minder dan 100 graden tijdens  het transport, wat een nieuw record is voor  extreme efficiëntie en resulteert in een jaarlijkse vermindering van meer dan 750.000 ton koolstofuitstoot. 
Li Xiaotong, Vice President bij ZTE, verklaarde:  ”We zijn vereerd dat we deze prijs in ontvangst mogen nemen namens het gezamenlijke projectteam. Dit project is  een van onze belangrijke  praktische successen in de digitale upgrade van de staalmetallurgie en procesindustrie. De erkenning van dit project door GSMA zal ook een drijvende kracht worden  voor onze voortdurende vooruitgang.  ZTE’s  end-to-end 5G private netwerkoplossing, toegepast in het industriepark van WISCO bij hoge temperaturen en elektromagnetische interferentie, beschikt over dezelfde netwerkcapaciteit als  het industriële ethernet  met de extra  voordelen van meer flexibele implementatie en gemakkelijkere toegang. ZTE is vastbesloten om in de toekomst met meer industriële partners  samen te werken  om de digitale transformatie en intelligente upgrade van de staalindustrie te bevorderen.” 
De jaarlijkse GLOMO Awards zijn de meest prestigieuze onderscheiding in de sector. Met een jury die dit jaar bestaat uit meer dan 240 wereldwijde analisten, mediaprofessionals en industrie-experts, bekronen de GLOMO Awards 2024 mensen en bedrijven die innovatie stimuleren en blijk geven van uitmuntendheid in de snel groeiende mobiele industrie.

BEIJING, March 1 (Reuters) - China’s manufacturing activity in February contracted for a fifth straight month, an official factory survey showed on Friday, raising the pressure on policymakers to roll out further stimulus measures as factory owners struggle for orders.
The official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 49.1 in February from 49.2 in January, below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and in line with a median forecast of 49.1 in a Reuters poll.

2024-02-29 16:05:32,Microsoft tailors AI for finance teams in specialized ’Copilot’ strategy," By Jeffrey Dastin 
(Reuters) - Microsoft on Thursday previewed an artificial intelligence tool for customers’ finance departments, part of a strategy tailoring new software to industries, professionals and ultimately individuals. 
The company said its tool, called Microsoft Copilot for Finance, helps users review data sets for risks, produce reports from raw numbers, and generally handle tasks they might otherwise outsource. It did not announce pricing or a date for wider availability. 
The new AI tool follows similar ones Microsoft has marketed for salespeople and customer-service representatives. 
Those typically cost $20 per user per month, on top of the subscription fees for software necessary to use these tools, such as its $30 Copilot for Microsoft 365. 
Emily He, a corporate vice president, told reporters that Microsoft may tailor future Copilots for marketing and supply-chain work. 
The company’s efforts to sell AI that handles sales and service tasks adds to its competition with Salesforce, which has a big focus on those areas. Salesforce on Tuesday announced availability for a competing AI assistant called Einstein Copilot. 
In a San Francisco media briefing, Microsoft demonstrated how its specialized AI could help customers generate emails or perform tasks while drawing from ”customer relationship management” (CRM) systems made by it or Salesforce. 
Charles Lamanna, a Microsoft corporate vice president, told reporters that sellers will go to a CRM ”far less, maybe never in the future, because Copilot will basically on their behalf go and keep the CRM up to date and pull the information from the CRM.” 
Such systems will remain in active use in the background, but the business models supporting them may well change, Lamanna said.

2024-03-01 03:17:00,"BITERA, A WORLD-CLASS DATA CENTER, IS PRESENT TO FOSTER THE NATION’S DIGITAL ECONOMY GROWTH"," JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitera, a world-class data center, officially held its Grand Launching on February 27, 2024. The inauguration was attended by several Indonesian government’s high-rank officials, including Bahlil Lahadalia, the Minister of Investment/Head of the Investment Coordinating Board, and Erick Thohir, the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN). The presence of these key leaders reflects the strong synergy between the Indonesian Government and the private sector, creating a solid foundation to drive the growth of Indonesia’s digital economy. 
”The penetration of data centers in Indonesia is currently still below 1 watt per capita, far compared to neighboring countries like Singapore at 100 watts per capita. As another comparison, the average consumption in Japan reaches 10 watts per capita, indicating that Indonesia still has a lot of room to grow in terms of data center infrastructure,” said Tedy Harjanto, CEO of Bitera. 
The low penetration of data centers in Indonesia is in line with data from the Association of Indonesian Internet Service Providers (APJII), which shows that the penetration of Data Centers in Indonesia is one of the lowest in Asia Pacific Region (APAC), at around 0.3 watts per capita. This number is far from the ideal capacity requirement of nearly 840 megawatts (MW) based on the total population. When compared to other ASEAN countries, the data center capacity in Indonesia is only equivalent to approximately 12.7 percent. 
”In line with Indonesia’s great potential in developing the digital economy, MMS Group Indonesia sees a significant upside for data centers. We believe Bitera will meet these needs and play a crucial role in supporting Indonesian digital economy development. Bitera’s presence also aligns with the government’s goal to drive the growth of nation’s digital economy through collaboration with the private sector,” said Sendy Greti, CEO of MMS Group Indonesia. 
Currently, Indonesia is still lagging behind in data center development compared to the target set for 2030. This is a serious concern, considering the important role of data centers as digital infrastructure in supporting the growth of Indonesia’s digital economy. 
Minister of Investment/Head of the Investment Coordinating Board, Bahlil Lahadalia, emphasized that digital infrastructure is the key requirement in the digital transformation of the Indonesian and global economy. Therefore, to achieve this goal, appropriate digital infrastructure is needed. 
”Bitera’s presence as a local pride data center represents a significant historical milestone on our nation’s digitalization journey. The presence of Bitera is expected to strengthen the national digital infrastructure in order to help preparing Indonesia to compete on the international stage, empowering MSMEs and startups through access to sophisticated technology,” said Bahlil. 
Bitera’s Grand Launching serves as an ideal platform to showcase the synergy between the government agenda and the private sector to shape a solid and sustainable digital future for Indonesia, especially that Bitera is a 100% Indonesian-owned company. 
Bitera offers critical IT load capacity of 20 MW with up to 4,000 racks. A Tier-III+ facility, it provides Five9s availability SLA (Service Level Agreement) and stands out as the safest data center in downtown Jakarta. Power reliability is also guaranteed through 2N redundancy supplied from two diversified substations. Recognition of dedication to security standards is reflected in obtained certifications such as ISO 27001 and Uptime Institute TCCD, and TCCF to be obtained by Bitera. 
”Bitera leverages its strategic location in proximity to internet exchange points in downtown Jakarta, providing easy access for connecting businesses to the digital ecosystem through interconnections with low latency.” Tedy said. 
Bitera has implemented energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies and achieved carbon neutrality. Moving forward, Bitera is committed to maintain its sustainability measures in the future. 
With Bitera’s presence as a pioneer of digital infrastructure solutions, Indonesia is ready to step forward into a more advanced and competitive digital economic era, offering new hope for development and innovation in the country. 
As an affiliate of MMS Group Indonesia, Bitera shares the same view to develop sustainable Indonesia. MMS Group Indonesia’s achievement in winning various prestigious awards related to sustainable energy transition serve as a strong illustration of their commitment to sustainable development in Indonesia.

Yellen, left, shakes hands with Saudi Arabia’s Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan before their bilateral meeting at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Andre Penner) 
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil’s finance minister told his peers Thursday at a G20 meeting in Sao Paulo that countries should implement a global tax on the super-rich in an effort to tackle rampant tax evasion. 
Fernando Haddad said tax evasion can be resolved through international cooperation so that “these few individuals make their contribution to our societies and to the planet’s sustainable development.” 
He added that Brazil is pushing for a declaration on international taxation by G20 members that he hopes would be ready in July. But in a press conference at the end of the meeting, he recognized the path would be far from smooth. 
“There will be a lot of debate about this, which is absolutely natural, especially because not every country feels the same way about this problem that was brought to the G20 by Brazil,” he said. 
Brazil currently has the presidency of the 20 leading rich and developing nations and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has put issues that concern the developing world – such as the reduction of inequalities and the reform of multilateral institutions — at the heart of its agenda. 
“Brazil has a role to play, a legitimacy to use on the issues that need to be addressed and that are not always represented in the G20,” Haddad said, pointing to environmental, social and fiscal issues. 
According to a 2023 study by advocacy group Tax Justice Network, countries around the world could lose up to $4.8 trillion in tax revenue over the next decade due to tax havens. And a report earlier this year by the EU Tax Observatory cited by Haddad, found that billionaires worldwide have effective tax rates equivalent of between 0% and 0.5% of their wealth. 
In recent years, scandals such as the Panama Papers Leak and the Paradise Papers have shone a light on the pervasiveness of tax evasion and avoidance in business practices. 
Meanwhile, the gap between the super-rich and the bulk of the global population has been supercharged since the coronavirus pandemic, according to anti-poverty organization Oxfam International. 
“There are fewer taxes on assets today than two or three decades ago. The global movement has tended towards reducing taxation on companies and wealth,” said André Vereta-Nahoum, a sociology professor at the University of Sao Paulo. 
But with inequalities soaring, more are calling for higher taxes on the wealthy – including U.S. President Joe Biden, who has pushed for a billionaire minimum income tax although the likelihood of Congress passing that proposal is minimal. 
In a sign of growing global consensus on the matter, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution late last year backing stronger international tax cooperation to “make it fully inclusive and more effective.” 
“The difficulty is no longer putting the issue on the table, the data is there. The difficulty is arriving at a common document,” said Carla Beni, an economist from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for February stood at 49.1, in line with the median forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters. This figure was slightly lower than January’s reading of 49.2; hence, the sector is still wallowing in contraction territory. 
On the other hand, the non-manufacturing PMI, which encompasses services and construction, recorded a reading of 51.4 and surpassed analyst expectations and marked an improvement from January’s figure of 50.7 and, in no small part due to the policymaker’s efforts to stabilize the property sectors. 
Still, The mixed performance across different sectors underscores the challenges policymakers face to get the demand side of the economy revving on all cylinders. While services and construction show signs of rebounding, the manufacturing sector continues to grapple with headwinds and subdued activity levels. 
The Yen remains in focus, with FX traders getting on and off the Bank Of Japan policy game of chance wheel. Outside of month-end Yen rebalancing swings, Governor Kazuo Ueda’s overnight remarks added another twist to market rate hike expectations. 
Despite new momentum anticipating potential rate hikes, Ueda emphasized that the BoJ’s price target remains elusive, indicating that the central bank is not ready to consider its first rate hike since 2007. 
In his statement following a meeting with a Group of 20 finance chiefs in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Ueda highlighted the importance of confirming whether the anticipated virtuous cycle between wages and prices has commenced.

März 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ZTE Corporation (0763.HK / 000063.SZ), ein weltweit führender Anbieter von Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologielösungen, gab in Partnerschaft mit Wuhan Iron and Steel Co.,Ltd. (WISCO) und China Unicom bekannt, dass ihr gemeinsames Projekt „5G Fully Connected Smart Steel Factory” (Vollständig 5G-vernetzte intelligente Stahlfabrik) bei den Global Mobile (GLOMO) Awards während des MWC Barcelona 2024 die Auszeichnung „Best Mobile Innovation for Connected Economy” (Beste mobile Innovation für die vernetzte Wirtschaft) erhielt. Die Auszeichnung ist eine Anerkennung für ihre beeindruckenden Bemühungen, die Arbeitsweise der Menschen in Fabriken zu verändern und den Arbeitsplatz zu digitalisieren. 
Seit 2020 hat die Zusammenarbeit zwischen WISCO und seinen Partnern zur Gründung des Projekts „5G Fully Connected Smart Steel Factory” geführt. Dieses Projekt hat sich nun zum größten 5G-Privatnetzwerk der globalen Stahlindustrie entwickelt und erreicht eine beeindruckende 99-prozentige 5G-Abdeckung innerhalb des Fabrikgeländes. Bei dem Projekt wird diese robuste private 5G-Netzwerkinfrastruktur genutzt und es wurden 25 Stahlanwendungen in sechs wichtigen Szenarien bereitgestellt. Diese Anwendungen umfassen intelligente Logistik, Produktionssteuerung, digitales Gerätemanagement, Energie- und Umweltkontrolle, Qualitätskontrolle und Sicherheitsmanagement. Um den Betrieb zu optimieren, hat das Werk ein Kontrollzentrum auf Unternehmensebene sowie dedizierte Betriebszentren für die Eisenherstellung, die Stahlherstellung, das CSP und das Warmwalzen eingerichtet. Dieser integrierte Ansatz hat den Weg für einen nahtlosen Stahlherstellungsprozess geebnet, bei dem alles aus einer Hand kommt. 
Das private 5G-Netzwerk wurde im wichtigsten Produktionsbereich von WISCO eingesetzt. Mehr als 100 Laufkrane haben den unbemannten Umbau abgeschlossen. Seit der Einführung des intelligenten Transports von geschmolzenem Eisen hat sich die Transporteffizienz kontinuierlich verbessert. Bemerkenswert ist, dass der Temperaturabfall von geschmolzenem Eisen während des Transports weniger als 100 Grad beträgt, was einen neuen Rekord für extreme Effizienz darstellt und zu einer jährlichen Reduzierung von über 750.000 Tonnen Kohlenstoffemissionen führt. 
Li Xiaotong, Vice President bei ZTE, sagte: „Wir fühlen uns geehrt, diese Auszeichnung im Namen des gemeinsamen Projektteams zu erhalten. Dieses Projekt ist eine unserer bedeutenden praktischen Errungenschaften bei der digitalen Modernisierung der Stahlmetallurgie und der Prozessindustrie. Die Anerkennung dieses Projekts durch die GSMA wird auch zu einer treibenden Kraft für unseren weiteren Fortschritt werden. Die Komplettlösung für private 5G-Netzwerke von ZTE, die im Industriepark von WISCO inmitten von hohen Temperaturen und elektromagnetischen Störungen eingesetzt wird, verfügt über dieselbe Netzwerkkapazität wie das industrielle Ethernet mit den zusätzlichen Vorteilen einer flexibleren Bereitstellung und eines bequemeren Zugangs. In Zukunft wird ZTE mit mehr Industriepartnern zusammenarbeiten, um die digitale Transformation und intelligente Modernisierung der Stahlindustrie voranzutreiben.” 
Die jährlichen GLOMO Awards sind die renommierteste Auszeichnung der Branche. Mit einer Jury, die in diesem Jahr über 240 globale Analysten, Medienfachleute und Branchenexperten umfasst, werden bei den GLOMO Awards 2024 Einzelpersonen und Unternehmen geehrt, die Innovationen vorantreiben und Spitzenleistungen in der schnell wachsenden mobilen Branche präsentieren.

2024-03-01 06:00:00,How the myth of the ‘state pension pot’ has warped Britain’s finances," State Pension Pot Jeremy Hunt 
Pick up your annual tax summary from HMRC and you will see 10pc of what the Government takes from you goes towards the state pension. 
It gives the impression that you, the taxpayer, are storing up a substantial nest egg to protect you in retirement. 
The phrase “National Insurance Contributions” (NICs) suggests that this tax goes into a fund that will be there to pay our state pension on retirement, or help with benefits should you need them. 
Unfortunately, anyone who gets that impression would be terribly mistaken. The money is not saved – taxes and NICs that are paid to HMRC today go straight out the door to pay pensioners who are currently claiming their retirement benefits. 
Each generation’s pensioners rely on the taxes of younger workers, an intergenerational compact that relies on continued participation. 
In the second of our three-part series on the future of the state pension, we look at how the myth of the “state pension pot” has evolved and what it means for the country. 
National Insurance is set to bring in just over £176bn for the Government in the coming financial year. Spending on pensioners – covering the state pension, pension credit, housing benefits for retirees and other support – will total £152bn. 
That leaves £24bn that theoretically could be set aside for future pension payments. Yet instead it goes towards spending on health, social care and any other parts of the state that needs the cash. 
The absence of any real ring-fenced pension pot is a problem. Britain’s population is ageing, meaning there are a growing number of pensioners. 
The state pension is rising at the same time thanks to the ratcheting effect of the triple lock. 
Under the current system, a growing number of retirees will be claiming increasingly generous payments that rely on the taxes of a relatively smaller pool of workers. 
In the short-run, taxpayers will be squeezed to cover the cost. National Insurance payments are set to rise by £25bn by 2028-29, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates, as frozen thresholds at a time of high inflation pull more workers into paying the tax. 
Pensioner payments are set to grow by around £20bn over the same period, meaning the ledger will balance. 
However, how long this arrangement will hold politically is an open question. 
Increases in National Insurance are fuelling a rise in the tax burden to levels not seen since the aftermath of the Second World War. The issue is growing more politically toxic by the day. 
The strategy of asking today’s workers to pay for current retirees’ pensions risks reaching breaking point. 
The “pay as you go” method of financing the state pension has been enshrined in the system ever since it came into being in its modern form in 1948. 
William Beveridge, the Liberal politician who helped engineer the welfare state, wanted a different model. He wanted workers to pay in first before qualifying for the pension. 
However, the Government was not keen to charge workers a tax for years before introducing a pension given the impoverished, war-weary state of the nation. Instead, it introduced an immediate financial safety net paid for through current taxes. 
The details of the system have changed since then. Past arrangements included earnings-related additional pensions, which allowed people to pay extra for a bigger pension, or a second state pension for low earners. 
Today, the new state pension, which was introduced in 2016, is a simple flat rate. Those who qualify get £203.85 per week, a figure which rises each year in line with the triple lock – the highest of inflation, average wages or 2.5pc. 
Workers need to rack up 35 years of National Insurance contributions to qualify for a full pension. 
Contributions are deducted automatically from people’s pay cheques once they are earning more than £1,048 a month. 
However, there are also other ways to build up eligibility – signing up for unemployment benefits while hunting for a job also counts to the 35 year requirement, for instance. Similarly, parents who receive child benefits also gain credit. The policy means that those who take time off work to raise a family do not blow a hole in their retirement provision. 
The generosity of the current system means Britain is “rapidly moving to a state pension system in which most people who live in the UK all their adult life get a full state pension”, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). 
Even people who take government-backed training courses can gain eligibility, points out Jonathan Cribb at the IFS. It means the liability of the state pension swells even as the income from National Insurance does not. 
Then there are top ups available to help those without a full new state pension with living costs, including pension credit and housing benefit. On top of that come old age handouts such as winter fuel payments and free bus passes. 
For those in retirement today, all of this is good news. 
“It provides a good base layer of income, particularly if you are a couple, particularly if you own your own home,” says Cribb. “With two full state pensions, you are definitely not going to be in income poverty with that.” 
Yet in terms of funding, the system is not particularly coherent. The link to National Insurance, for instance, is not consistent. 
Pensions or future allowances did not rise when Rishi Sunak as Chancellor increased the rate of National Insurance contributions in April 2022. Nor did they fall when Kwasi Kwarteng reversed the increase or when Jeremy Hunt cut the tax further at the start of this year. 
Meanwhile, someone who has achieved 35 years of NI contributions is still charged National Insurance even though it is of no further use to their ultimate pension allowance. 
The inconsistencies highlight the increasingly shaky position of the state pension. 
Politicians have long acknowledged a brewing problem but past attempts to solve it have proved futile. 
In 1997, the Conservatives proposed turning the “pay as you go” system into a “fully funded” arrangement. Workers would pay the same tax and National Insurance but a chunk would be invested in the manner of a private pension pot, hopefully growing over time. 
However, pension reform was not the issue of the day and Tony Blair’s Labour party vanquished John Major’s Conservatives in that year’s election. The proposal was left to gather dust. 
The coalition government took steps towards addressing the issue by introducing auto enrolled private pensions in 2012. 
Unless workers opt out, or do not meet the minimum income threshold, a slice of their earnings now go into a savings scheme that will give them a pension on retirement. The share of employees with a private pension has risen from below half in to almost 80pc as a result. 
Auto enrolled pensions should theoretically wean future retirees off a dependence on the state pension, giving governments leeway to reform the way it is funded or how much it pays out. 
Yet the wild success of the triple lock, which was also introduced by the coalition government around the same time, has effectively nullified this opportunity. Successive administrations have struggled to do anything other than increase the generosity of the state pension. 
Rishi Sunak plans to retain the “triple lock” on state pensions if he wins the next election, the Telegraph revealed this week. It is a sure vote winner – yet the issue of who and how these future promises will be sustainable paid for remains."

Key Points
”If you look at the GDP numbers ... India’s poised for about 8% growth this year, that makes India easily the fastest growing economy in the world” — Krishnamurthy Subramanian, executive director at the IMF and former chief economic advisor of India.
India’s economy grew much faster than expected in the October to December quarter, data showed late on Thursday.

India is ’easily’ the fastest growing economy in the world, IMF executive director Krishnamurthy Subramanian said, as the country’s third-quarter GDP growth blew past analysts’ estimates.
At 8.4%, India’s economy expanded at its fastest pace in six quarters, data showed late on Thursday, strong private consumption and upbeat manufacturing and construction activity. Reuters estimates had pegged growth in the October to December period at 6.6%.
”If you look at the GDP numbers ... India’s poised for about 8% growth this year,” Subramanian, who is also a former chief economic advisor to the Indian government told CNBC’s ” Squawk Box Asia ” on Friday.
The Indian government also raised its GDP growth outlook for fiscal year 2023-24 to 7.6% from 7.3% forecast earlier.
Subramanian said that growth in India’s economy was driven by a shift in the government’s focus towards higher capital expenditure, which has increased significantly over the last few years.

The Indian Finance Ministry presented a fiscally prudent interim budget in early February, estimating that fiscal deficit for the financial year 2025 will narrow to 5.1%  from the revised 5.8% for 2024, while emphasizing the government’s plan to boost spending on infrastructure.
The interim budget estimated that capital expenditure will rise by 11.1% to 11.11 trillion Indian rupees ($133.9 billion) in fiscal year 2025, while tax revenue for the year is expected to increase by 11.4% to 38.31 trillion rupees.
Subramanian said he expected similar fiscal prudence from the full union budget, which will be released after India’s general elections.
”I do expect the focus on capital expenditure to continue and the fiscal math also is looking very responsible,” he added.
The GDP data has boosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic record ahead of a highly anticipated national election.
”For PM Modi and BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) who will be going to the polls in April-May, it will yet provide another boost. For RBI (Reserve Bank of India), the strong growth momentum will only reinforce their bias to stay on hold at 6.5% for the foreseeable future,” Commerzbank analysts wrote in a note."

The West-financed non-governmental organizations are destabilizing the situation in post-Soviet countries seeking to create a ”belt of instability” around Russia, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. 
”Every year, the West allocates billions of dollars and euro to finance NGOs and media in Russia and other post-Soviet countries. In 2020, more than 2,000 NGOs and media outlets operated in the CIS countries on this money. Obviously, you know their agenda,” she said at the second congress of the International Movement of Russophiles. 
”The result of their so-called work is inevitable destabilization of the socio-political and economic situation in these countries, which creates the so-called belt of instability around Russia,” she said. 
Such efforts, in her words, are geared toward ”discrediting the regimes, governments and political forces in countries, which conduct an independent domestic and foreign policy, promoting their own political and moral values without taking into account the level of the development of political institutions, cultural and religious traditions and values in these countries.” ”Financial support is rendered to various extremist, political, and religious organizations,” she added."

2024-03-01 08:00:51,Galway County Council to adopt Ireland’s first Waste Management Plan for a circular economy,"Galway County Council is set to adopt Ireland’s first National Waste Management
Plan for a Circular Economy which launched today.

This plan aims to tackle the significant waste challenges faced in Ireland and
provides a new framework for the prevention and management of waste from 2024 to
2030.

The plan sets out an ambitious target of 0% waste growth per person. This means
the amount of waste generated for each person is not going to increase above
existing levels.

This equates to an effective 7-10% reduction in predicted waste generation by
2030.

The Plan emphasizes waste reduction from commercial activities and the
construction and demolition sector and identifies 16 focus areas with 85
priority actions.

“As a nation, we’ve seen a significant increase in the amount of waste generated
each year and it’s having a dramatic impact on our environment, our climate and
our natural resources,” Kevin Swift, Regional Waste Co-ordinator Connacht
Ulster.

“Last year alone we collected over 13 and a half million tonnes of waste – or
over 2 tonnes per person. That’s the equivalent weight of two cars! This cannot
continue.”

“We urgently need a new approach, and this plan provides a roadmap for how we
can produce less waste and become more circular by repairing, reusing, and
recycling more.”

The plan also aims to encourage sustainable consumption, with proposals for more
awareness campaigns, education programmes, and demonstration projects, as well
as promoting the correct use of collection bins.

It’s anticipated that the combined effect of these interventions will prevent
300,000 tonnes of waste over the life of this Plan and increase the recycling
rate by up to 9%,” said Mr Swift.

“It’s also really important that we become more creative with the waste we do
produce and look at innovative ways to encourage recycling such as the Deposit
Return Scheme,” he added.

The private waste sector in Ireland is valued at over €1.4bn and provides
employment for approximately 10,000 people.

The total Local Authority expenditure on waste functions exceeds €280M annually
and involves over 1700 people.

The scale of the financial and human commitment to waste services is large, yet
the plan highlights that the transition to a circular economy will require
additional State investment of at least €40 million to achieve the desired
outcomes."

Question and Answer Session 
Operator 
Our first question comes from Mickey Schleien with Ladenburg because Good afternoon stored and Georgeson. 
Mickey Schleien 
Hi, one question. This afternoon, Stuart, you mentioned how aggressive the market has become and spreads were tighter spreads and as more liquid end of the continuum and your focus now on direct origination, which as we know is harder to source and has a longer lead time. So are you are you comfortable in the BDC’s ability to potentially replace all these repayments that you’re likely to see with the direct origination deal flow in this environment that we’re experiencing? 
Stuart Aronson 
And on the BDC balance sheet that could look like deals that were at $700 being replaced with deals that are $650 or $675 on. But there’s definitely been a tightening of the pricing market in the sponsor sector. And as we’ve always shared with you, the non-sponsor sector remains pretty stable with pricing on deals typically between sulfur 650 and sulfur 900. 
Mickey Schleien 
Thanks, Stuart. That’s very helpful. That’s my only question this afternoon. 
Stuart Aronson 
Thank you, Mickey. 
Operator 
Next question comes from Bryce Rowe with B. Riley. 
Bryce Rowe 
Thanks. Good afternoon, Celebros Stuart, let me let me kind of start with the, um, some of the commentary around quarter to date, first quarter to date repayment activity, you noted five deals. I’m curious if those are driven by kind of price refinance or were they are they kind of slated for award they slated for maturity here in 24, maybe even driven by kind of M&A activity. 
Stuart Aronson 
Bryce, one of the deals was a deal that was maturing and the sponsor owner of the company not only wanted to refinance the debt, but wanted to take a dividend. And given the credit profile of the Company, we did not feel comfortable giving the Company a dividend, whereas the other lenders that were in the company did feel comfortable doing it. So that deal refinanced, but we chose to exit the other deals that repaid were mostly based on M&A activity where companies were being sold and we were getting repaid on the sale of those companies. 
Bryce Rowe 
And if you looked at kind of your schedule of investments, you have, I guess, a decent amount of maturities in 24 on that. How do you how do you how do you feel about, you know, those those kind of getting to the finish line D, do you think they can get refinanced within the BDC or the kind of foresee them from moving outside of the BDC. 
Stuart Aronson 
And for those situations, we would hope to our refinance those companies or follow them to new owners. But we have other companies where we see long-term trend lines that we are less optimistic about. And as these companies come up for refinancing, we will probably not definitely but probably choose to exit. So there really is a mix based on our credit outlook for each of the deals. But the market is very aggressive right now and anything that we have that’s maturing that is performing and marked at a normal level. We feel highly confident that the market will refinance those transactions with no problem. 
Bryce Rowe 
As you noted, the capacity both at the BDC level and at the at the JV, does that capacity or let’s say, with us this way, the capacity at the JV, is it taken up with the new deals that have already been kind of transferred in there? And is that kind of based on that, I guess, to current equity capital or borrowing base within the within the JV? I mean, do you have kind of more more firepower behind that in terms of being able to have to invest or commit more capital into the JV. 
Stuart Aronson 
I believe that the numbers of $50 million for the BDC balance sheet and $40 million for the JV, take into account all the recent transfers that we have done, they do not take into account the deals that are in pipeline that we are looking to close and again, all the new deals in pipeline that are looking to close our non-sponsor deals and all of those deals are priced at. So for six, 50 or higher, in fact, one of the nonsponsor deals will be closed here in Q. one was at modest leverage and modest loan to value. But because of our origination network, we were able to source an opportunity at so for plus 900. So that was and that’s a first lien deal at at the normal what we would call bank terms. So very, very good origination on that. 
Bryce Rowe 
Thanks. 
Stuart Aronson 
I mentioned earlier that our Crown brands, we may be exiting this quarter and we have negotiated an exit on that. That if it happens, will be that that deal was marked up in the last quarter. And if we get this transaction done as contemplated it will be at a price that’s even higher than the current mark at. 
Bryce Rowe 
Thanks, Stuart. 
Stuart Aronson 
Thank you, Brian. 
Operator 
Your next question comes from Erik Zwick with Health Group. 
Erik Zwick 
Good afternoon. Sort of one wanted to start first with a question on the pipeline, which you’ve mentioned, David has a number of attractive opportunities on it and a number in process now. But wondering if you could maybe provide a little additional commentary in terms of the mix in terms of new versus add-on opportunities and also whether there’s any kind of common themes you’re noticing in terms of the type of opportunities and or kind of by industry or region of the country that you’re seeing. 
Stuart Aronson 
The add-on opportunities for the most part price above the current market because those deals were done in a higher priced market, although borrowers are looking for adjustments to price based on the fact that the market has become more aggressive on, as I mentioned before, all of the new pipeline activity that is mandated right now are nonsponsor deals. And all of those nonsponsor deals are priced at six, 50 and above, so would be targeted for the BDC balance sheet and there is no particular sector that we are finding more attractive. I would say what we are seeing there was recently a deal that was brought to us for a company that we thought was a good company and a scaled company, but it was a cyclical company. And on a cyclical, we don’t like putting more than four times leverage on the Company and this deal came to us at five and a quarter times leverage and about 65% loan to value. And we just found that to be a stunningly high leverage multiple and loan to value for a cyclical company heading into what we believe is a weakening economy. And so despite the fact that that deal was well priced at $650 or above, we walked away from that opportunity. So we are sticking to our knitting as it regards a conservative credit outlook and the non-sponsor deals that we’re working on. I believe are all levered between three and four times. So modest leverage, good foot, good cash flow coverages and companies that we believe will be are either non-cyclical or light cyclicals. 
Erik Zwick 
I appreciate the additional details there. And then I’m just looking at slide 8 of the presentation. I noticed that the average investment size in the portfolio has come down about $1 million since third quarter of third quarter of ’22. So curious if that’s something, you know that you guys have actively been trying to do to work the position size smaller or if it’s more reflective, as you said, kind of the larger end of the market becoming more competitive? And just curious, would you expect that trend to continue? I’m just thinking that certainly at smaller deals makes it a little bit harder too kind of run in place and keep the portfolio size the same, but also potentially have some benefits in terms of lower concentration to particular position. So it shows, but your thoughts there? 
Stuart Aronson 
Yes, for a significant portion of the last two years, the VDC. has either been full or almost full and not able to take on new deals. So we actually feel good about the fact that we’re getting some repayments and getting the opportunity to put new deals into the BDC arm. We definitely believe with our three-tier sourcing architecture that we are well-positioned to continue to bring in a solid flow of deals. We are definitely, as I mentioned earlier, focused in on on the off the run market and the nonsponsor market, which sometimes do smaller deals to sometimes do larger deals on. I would say that in general, over the last quarter, you’re correct that the deals we were doing were more lower mid-market deals. And as a result, the average asset allocation to the BDC was a little bit lower. But in general, the most important thing is we are not putting any large concentrations in the BDC. When I first joined, we had positions that were $35 million or $40 million which on a BDC of our size, we thought was just too much of a concentration and we are going to keep our maximum allocations to no more than approximately $20 million going forward with an average allocation that will probably be closer to $8 million to $10 million to give us good diversity across the portfolio. 
Erik Zwick 
I appreciate the commentary, and thanks for taking my questions. 
Stuart Aronson 
No problem. 
Operator 
Our next question comes from Melissa Wedel with JPMorgan. 
Melissa Wedel 
Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. And finally, if possible, I missed this, but I wanted to check in with you about whether or not you provided a specific amount on the post quarter end and new investment activity? I think you said there were $39 million of repayments subsequent to quarter end, but I’m not sure we got a total amount on the origination side. 
Stuart Aronson 
I think it was five deals closed. But Jason, do you have how much volume, the new deals and add-on deals represented in this quarter so far. 
Joyson Thomas 
In regards to new deployments, during during Q1, they approximated about $30 million. So I think the way to think about this right now is as of the end of Q4 to Stuart’s earlier comments, we had about $50 million of capacity on the BDC balance sheet, taking into account the approximately $40 million of repayments during Q1. And then that gets offset by the $30 million of deployments we just did in Q1 currently right now. So I think that’s the best way to think about it. 
Melissa Wedel 
That’s really helpful. Thank you. And I wanted to also follow up about your comments on sort of the pipeline and it sounds like it’s very clear based on your comments today that there is strong preference for the non-sponsored space just because of and the terms, the pricing, the leverage levels you can get there right now, would you say that that segment is developed, the pipeline is developing as strongly as sort of the sponsored space? Or is it a little bit tougher to source those Thank you. 
Stuart Aronson 
On non-sponsor business is always much harder to find much harder and longer to underwrite and frankly, even more complicated from a portfolio perspective. That said, our experience including during the COVID downturn, is that the non-sponsored deals that we do because they’re very conservatively structured and levered have performed as well or better than our sponsor portfolio on. So we are actively involved in sourcing those nonsponsor effort of those nonsponsor transactions. It is frankly harder to source them than it is to source to sponsor deals, which just sort of come out on a regular basis, but we have 22 originators in 11 locations across North America and many of whom understand that their primary responsibility is to source either nonsponsor or off-the-run sponsor deals. And those teams due to the fact that we’ve had extremely low turnover over the past three years are very experienced in their regions and more broadly and our pipeline is solid at the moment. The pipeline is certainly not as large as it was in 2021 or even 2022. But it’s similar to what it was in 2023. And from what we hear in the marketplace with the more aggressive terms available in the financing market, there’s more M&A and more M&A activity going on and that should feed both our sponsor and non-sponsor pipeline. 
Melissa Wedel 
That’s really helpful. I appreciate it. And one last one, if I could sneak it in there, right. So in the non-sponsored space. You mentioned that I think the the example that you gave were the owner wanted a dividend and to do a refi, you were comfortable with refi, not the dividend, et cetera, it begs the question in the non-sponsored space, what are you seeing the use of capital and as being right now that have a lot of refi activity or non-sponsored companies also engaging in M&A? Thank you. 
Stuart Aronson 
But so these are primarily growth loans and again, the pickup in M&A activity broadly across the market does serve both nonsponsor and sponsor deal flow. 
Melissa Wedel 
Makes sense. Thanks so much. 
Operator 
This does conclude today’s question and answer period. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. 
Stuart Aronson 
Thank you very much.

I mean, do you have kind of more more firepower behind that in terms of being able to have to invest or commit more capital into the JV. 
Stuart Aronson 
I believe that the numbers of $50 million for the BDC balance sheet and $40 million for the JV, take into account all the recent transfers that we have done, they do not take into account the deals that are in pipeline that we are looking to close and again, all the new deals in pipeline that are looking to close our non-sponsor deals and all of those deals are priced at. So for six, 50 or higher, in fact, one of the nonsponsor deals will be closed here in Q. one was at modest leverage and modest loan to value. But because of our origination network, we were able to source an opportunity at so for plus 900. So that was and that’s a first lien deal at at the normal what we would call bank terms. So very, very good origination on that. 
Bryce Rowe 
Thanks. 
Stuart Aronson 
I mentioned earlier that our Crown brands, we may be exiting this quarter and we have negotiated an exit on that. That if it happens, will be that that deal was marked up in the last quarter. And if we get this transaction done as contemplated it will be at a price that’s even higher than the current mark at. 
Bryce Rowe 
Thanks, Stuart. 
Stuart Aronson 
Thank you, Brian.

Your next question comes from Erik Zwick with Health Group. 
Erik Zwick 
Good afternoon. Sort of one wanted to start first with a question on the pipeline, which you’ve mentioned, David has a number of attractive opportunities on it and a number in process now. But wondering if you could maybe provide a little additional commentary in terms of the mix in terms of new versus add-on opportunities and also whether there’s any kind of common themes you’re noticing in terms of the type of opportunities and or kind of by industry or region of the country that you’re seeing. 
Stuart Aronson 
The add-on opportunities for the most part price above the current market because those deals were done in a higher priced market, although borrowers are looking for adjustments to price based on the fact that the market has become more aggressive on, as I mentioned before, all of the new pipeline activity that is mandated right now are nonsponsor deals. And all of those nonsponsor deals are priced at six, 50 and above, so would be targeted for the BDC balance sheet and there is no particular sector that we are finding more attractive. I would say what we are seeing there was recently a deal that was brought to us for a company that we thought was a good company and a scaled company, but it was a cyclical company. And on a cyclical, we don’t like putting more than four times leverage on the Company and this deal came to us at five and a quarter times leverage and about 65% loan to value. And we just found that to be a stunningly high leverage multiple and loan to value for a cyclical company heading into what we believe is a weakening economy. And so despite the fact that that deal was well priced at $650 or above, we walked away from that opportunity. So we are sticking to our knitting as it regards a conservative credit outlook and the non-sponsor deals that we’re working on. I believe are all levered between three and four times. So modest leverage, good foot, good cash flow coverages and companies that we believe will be are either non-cyclical or light cyclicals. 
Erik Zwick 
I appreciate the additional details there. And then I’m just looking at slide 8 of the presentation. I noticed that the average investment size in the portfolio has come down about $1 million since third quarter of third quarter of ’22. So curious if that’s something, you know that you guys have actively been trying to do to work the position size smaller or if it’s more reflective, as you said, kind of the larger end of the market becoming more competitive? And just curious, would you expect that trend to continue? I’m just thinking that certainly at smaller deals makes it a little bit harder too kind of run in place and keep the portfolio size the same, but also potentially have some benefits in terms of lower concentration to particular position. So it shows, but your thoughts there? 
Stuart Aronson 
Yes, for a significant portion of the last two years, the VDC. has either been full or almost full and not able to take on new deals. So we actually feel good about the fact that we’re getting some repayments and getting the opportunity to put new deals into the BDC arm. We definitely believe with our three-tier sourcing architecture that we are well-positioned to continue to bring in a solid flow of deals. We are definitely, as I mentioned earlier, focused in on on the off the run market and the nonsponsor market, which sometimes do smaller deals to sometimes do larger deals on. I would say that in general, over the last quarter, you’re correct that the deals we were doing were more lower mid-market deals. And as a result, the average asset allocation to the BDC was a little bit lower. But in general, the most important thing is we are not putting any large concentrations in the BDC. When I first joined, we had positions that were $35 million or $40 million which on a BDC of our size, we thought was just too much of a concentration and we are going to keep our maximum allocations to no more than approximately $20 million going forward with an average allocation that will probably be closer to $8 million to $10 million to give us good diversity across the portfolio. 
Erik Zwick 
I appreciate the commentary, and thanks for taking my questions. 
Stuart Aronson 
No problem. 
Operator 
Our next question comes from Melissa Wedel with JPMorgan. 
Melissa Wedel 
Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. And finally, if possible, I missed this, but I wanted to check in with you about whether or not you provided a specific amount on the post quarter end and new investment activity? I think you said there were $39 million of repayments subsequent to quarter end, but I’m not sure we got a total amount on the origination side. 
Stuart Aronson 
I think it was five deals closed. But Jason, do you have how much volume, the new deals and add-on deals represented in this quarter so far. 
Joyson Thomas 
In regards to new deployments, during during Q1, they approximated about $30 million. So I think the way to think about this right now is as of the end of Q4 to Stuart’s earlier comments, we had about $50 million of capacity on the BDC balance sheet, taking into account the approximately $40 million of repayments during Q1. And then that gets offset by the $30 million of deployments we just did in Q1 currently right now. So I think that’s the best way to think about it. 
Melissa Wedel 
That’s really helpful. Thank you. And I wanted to also follow up about your comments on sort of the pipeline and it sounds like it’s very clear based on your comments today that there is strong preference for the non-sponsored space just because of and the terms, the pricing, the leverage levels you can get there right now, would you say that that segment is developed, the pipeline is developing as strongly as sort of the sponsored space? Or is it a little bit tougher to source those Thank you. 
Stuart Aronson 
On non-sponsor business is always much harder to find much harder and longer to underwrite and frankly, even more complicated from a portfolio perspective. That said, our experience including during the COVID downturn, is that the non-sponsored deals that we do because they’re very conservatively structured and levered have performed as well or better than our sponsor portfolio on. So we are actively involved in sourcing those nonsponsor effort of those nonsponsor transactions. It is frankly harder to source them than it is to source to sponsor deals, which just sort of come out on a regular basis, but we have 22 originators in 11 locations across North America and many of whom understand that their primary responsibility is to source either nonsponsor or off-the-run sponsor deals. And those teams due to the fact that we’ve had extremely low turnover over the past three years are very experienced in their regions and more broadly and our pipeline is solid at the moment. The pipeline is certainly not as large as it was in 2021 or even 2022. But it’s similar to what it was in 2023. And from what we hear in the marketplace with the more aggressive terms available in the financing market, there’s more M&A and more M&A activity going on and that should feed both our sponsor and non-sponsor pipeline. 
Melissa Wedel 
That’s really helpful. I appreciate it. And one last one, if I could sneak it in there, right. So in the non-sponsored space. You mentioned that I think the the example that you gave were the owner wanted a dividend and to do a refi, you were comfortable with refi, not the dividend, et cetera, it begs the question in the non-sponsored space, what are you seeing the use of capital and as being right now that have a lot of refi activity or non-sponsored companies also engaging in M&A? Thank you. 
Stuart Aronson 
But so these are primarily growth loans and again, the pickup in M&A activity broadly across the market does serve both nonsponsor and sponsor deal flow. 
Melissa Wedel 
Makes sense. Thanks so much.

2024-02-29 22:05:42,Brazil’s finance minister proposes global tax on the super-rich at G20 meeting in Sao Paulo,"Print
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil’s finance minister told his peers Thursday at a G20 meeting in Sao Paulo that countries should implement a global tax on the super-rich in an effort to tackle rampant tax evasion.
Fernando Haddad said tax evasion can be resolved through international cooperation so that “these few individuals make their contribution to our societies and to the planet’s sustainable development.”
He added that Brazil is pushing for a declaration on international taxation by G20 members that he hopes would be ready in July. But in a press conference at the end of the meeting, he recognized the path would be far from smooth.
“There will be a lot of debate about this, which is absolutely natural, especially because not every country feels the same way about this problem that was brought to the G20 by Brazil,” he said.

Taylor Swift is demanding this college student stop tracking her private jet
Brazil currently has the presidency of the 20 leading rich and developing nations and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has put issues that concern the developing world – such as the reduction of inequalities and the reform of multilateral institutions — at the heart of its agenda.
“Brazil has a role to play, a legitimacy to use on the issues that need to be addressed and that are not always represented in the G20,” Haddad said, pointing to environmental, social and fiscal issues.
According to a 2023 study by advocacy group Tax Justice Network, countries around the world could lose up to $4.8 trillion in tax revenue over the next decade due to tax havens. And a report earlier this year by the EU Tax Observatory cited by Haddad, found that billionaires worldwide have effective tax rates equivalent of between 0% and 0.5% of their wealth.

In recent years, scandals such as the Panama Papers Leak and the Paradise Papers have shone a light on the pervasiveness of tax evasion and avoidance in business practices.
Meanwhile, the gap between the super-rich and the bulk of the global population has been supercharged since the coronavirus pandemic, according to anti-poverty organization Oxfam International.
“There are fewer taxes on assets today than two or three decades ago. The global movement has tended towards reducing taxation on companies and wealth,” said André Vereta-Nahoum, a sociology professor at the University of Sao Paulo.
But with inequalities soaring, more are calling for higher taxes on the wealthy – including U.S. President Joe Biden, who has pushed for a billionaire minimum income tax although the likelihood of Congress passing that proposal is minimal.
In a sign of growing global consensus on the matter, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution late last year backing stronger international tax cooperation to “make it fully inclusive and more effective.”
“The difficulty is no longer putting the issue on the table, the data is there. The difficulty is arriving at a common document,” said Carla Beni, an economist from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank.

Just register Chinese economy myFT Digest – delivered straight to your inbox. 
China’s economy has shown further signs of sluggish momentum as factory activity slowed, increasing pressure on President Xi Jinping to do more to boost growth, days before Beijing opens its annual key political event. 
The country’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index was 49.1 in February, according to figures released on Friday. It is below the value of 49.2 in January and corresponds to a Reuters analyst forecast. A value below 50 marks a decrease compared to the previous month. 
The continued weakness in China’s manufacturing PMI, which has been below 50 for five consecutive months and every month since March except September, comes as Beijing is set to open the annual session of its official parliament, the National People’s Congress, on Tuesday. where it will announce its targets for economic growth and fiscal stimulus this year. 
Thousands of delegates from across the country will descend on Beijing next week for the meeting, where the Communist Party will also announce its military budget for the year, possible leadership changes and its policy priorities. 
The poor PMI reading will increase pressure on policymakers to announce stronger stimulus measures, with the Chinese Communist Party’s governing body, the Politburo, suggesting this week that more may be needed, although few expect Beijing to take a for The Chinese economy’s typical “bazooka” package is a thing of the past. 
“A proactive financial policy must be intensified accordingly,” the Politburo said on Thursday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. 
“Overall, both February production and consumption data suggest that both businesses and consumers remain cautious,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group. He warned that the month included fewer working days than usual due to the Lunar New Year holiday, making it a less reliable indicator of the health of the economy. 
Analysts expect Beijing to announce a growth target of around 5 percent for 2024. This would be the same as last year, which was the lowest in decades. This year, however, that would be harder to achieve in the absence of a low base effect from the coronavirus pandemic to flatter growth in 2023. 
Policymakers are also grappling with a multi-year slowdown in the real estate sector, which they are trying to offset by focusing on high-value manufacturing and infrastructure investments. 
“We must vigorously promote the construction of a modern industrial system and accelerate the development of new productive forces,” the Politburo said.

The non-manufacturing index, which covers services and construction, painted a better picture for consumption. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the figure rose to 51.4 in February from 50.7 in the previous month. 
The NBS said that while activity in the construction sector weakened slightly and property activity contracted, other sectors such as catering, transport and entertainment were in a “boom” zone of over 55 as millions traveled during the Lunar New Year holiday. 
However, analysts warned that consumer and investor confidence remained relatively low. 
Ahead of the data release, Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said economic indicators for January and February taken together should provide a more comprehensive picture of the state of the Chinese economy. 
“Key growth indicators are likely to show a broad-based slowdown in their annual growth rates in January-February compared to December last year as the base effect has weakened due to the Covid exit wave at the end of 2022,” he said."

Thailand announces extra holiday to boost Songkran economy
5 minutes ago
 
Thailand’s financial sector is set to benefit from an additional public holiday, as declared by the Royal Thai Government Gazette. The special holiday is part of a government initiative to facilitate travel flexibility and stimulate the tourism, service sectors, and the overall economy during the Songkran festival.
 
This move aligns with the Cabinet’s decision from February 13, and marks a strategic effort to distribute travel and boost economic activities nationwide.
 
The Royal Thai Government Gazette’s latest announcement indicates that the Bank of Thailand, under the signature of Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput, has agreed to an extra holiday for financial institutions. This special holiday is designed to support the government’s policy to promote domestic travel and economic growth during the traditional Thai New Year, reported KhaoSod.
 
With the approval of the Cabinet, Friday, April 12, 2024, will be an additional non-working day for financial institutions. This measure is expected to create a four-day weekend, providing an opportunity for Thai citizens to travel and partake in all of Thailand’s Songkran festivities, which could in turn invigorate the nation’s local economy.
 
In related news, following UNESCO’s recognition of Songkran as an intangible cultural heritage, Thailand announced plans for the World Songkran Festival nationwide. This celebration aims to showcase local traditions and activities associated with the festival across the country’s provinces and districts. The journey towards UNESCO recognition began in 2020 when the government applied to the organisation.
 
Alongside this announcement, the Labour Ministry is considering raising the minimum wage for certain professions as a Songkran gift, with an expected announcement within a year.
 
Additionally, discussions about providing a full monthly salary for maternity leave are underway. In another development, the State Railway of Thailand introduces a game-changing 90-day advance booking service for CNR express trains on key routes, addressing the surge in travel demand expected during the upcoming Songkran festivities.

2024-03-01 11:01:37,Miga sticks by €349mn guarantee for African trade finance,"The World Bank’s investment guarantee agency has renewed €349mn in cover for a
Standard Chartered-led loan to the Eastern and Southern African Trade and
Development Bank (TDB), which will be used to finance trade transactions. 

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Miga) is providing the cover, with
a tenor of seven years, for a syndicated loan provided to TDB by Standard
Chartered’s UK entity and Kenyan branch, and Citi.

The guarantee replaces one Miga issued for the first time in 2020 for €358.9mn
with a tenor of up to ten years, although original lenders MUFG and SMBC are no
longer participating, according to a Miga spokesperson.

Miga says in a statement that the funding will support TDB’s trade finance
operations and help close the African trade finance gap, which the African
Development Bank (AfDB) estimated to be US$81.8bn in 2019 and has likely grown
since. 

TDB will use the facility to provide short-term financing facilities supporting
specific transactions for both in-land and cross-border trade, according to
Miga. 

“Miga is expanding its footprint in sub-Saharan Africa by supporting trusted
partners like TDB,” says Hiroshi Matano, the organisation’s executive vice
president. “Our trade finance guarantees offer a crucial instrument for
attracting foreign direct investment, providing access to liquidity for low- and
middle- income countries.” 

TDB’s member countries include some of the world’s poorest, where access to
trade finance can be limited. Banks are increasingly looking to multilateral
lenders and development banks to help bridge the trade finance gap in Africa,
especially for SMEs that offer low returns for traditional lenders. 

“We are proud to be working together [with Miga] to help grow and transform our
region’s economies through innovative trade finance solutions – important
catalysts to our sustainable development,” says TDB group president and managing
director Admassu Tadesse. 

The Miga announcement comes on the heels of a US$150mn unfunded risk
participation agreement between the TDB and African Development Bank (AfDB),
announced on February 27.

Under the agreement AfDB will guarantee up to 75% of qualifying trade
transactions, on a risk share basis with TDB, for qualifying banks in the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa. 

The AfDB says the arrangement is designed to help boost intra-Africa trade
flows, and is forecast to support around US$1.8bn in trade over three years. 

Miga is also set to close another deal with Standard Chartered involving a
€190mn trade finance facilityto the government of Senegal, following a similar
arrangement concluded last year with Rand Merchant Bank. Board approval for the
Standard Chartered deal is expected on March 8, Miga’s website shows.

China’s factory activity shrank for the fifth month, as the country’s economic indicators continue to show signs of trouble.
The nation’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for February stood at 49.1, a slight decrease from January’s 49.2, aligning with Reuters’ analysts’ expectations, the Financial Times reported on Friday. A PMI reading below 50 indicates a contraction, marking the fifth-consecutive month of decline, a trend only broken by one positive reading in September since last March, the newspaper reported.
”The combination of weakening growth, slumping confidence, entrenched deflation, a real estate meltdown , and swooning financial markets ought to be a clarion call for policymakers to act decisively and soon,” Eswar Prasad, professor of economics at Cornell University, told the Financial Times.

As China’s economy shows signs of sluggish momentum with slowing factory activity, the pressure is mounting on President Xi Jinping to take decisive action to stimulate growth. The latest figures precede the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPS), set to commence on Tuesday.
”At the NPC meeting, the government will need to come up with something more compelling than an optimistic growth target that by itself will probably do little to revive household and business confidence,” Prasad told the Financial Times.
The Congress arrives amid challenges , including a multi-year slowdown in the property sector, entrenched deflation and dwindling investor sentiment, which has seen foreign direct investment hit record lows.
Officials aim to counter these economic woes by focusing on high-end manufacturing and infrastructure investments. The annual meeting in Beijing will gather thousands of delegates from across the country, where the Chinese Communist Party will outline its economic growth targets, fiscal stimulus plans, military spending, senior personnel changes and other policy priorities for the year.
Contrasting with the manufacturing sector’s weakness, the non-manufacturing index, encompassing services and construction, exhibited signs of strength. The index rose to 51.4 in February from 50.7 in January, suggesting a more robust consumption sector, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said, according to Xinhua.

”The sub-indices of retail sales, rail transport, road transport, catering, ecological protection and the management of public facilities all stood above 53, while those of air transport, monetary and financial services, and culture, sports and entertainment all stood above 60,” NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said, according to Xinhua.
Despite a slight decline in construction and real estate activities, sectors such as catering, transport and entertainment thrived, particularly as millions traveled during the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on February 10 this year.
The seasonal impact of the Lunar New Year, which led to factory closures as workers returned home, contributed to the manufacturing sector’s sluggishness.
A survey by Caixin/S&P Global revealed expansion in manufacturing activity, with production and new orders growing faster, Reuters reported on Friday. These mixed signals from the PMIs underscore an uneven economic recovery in China, maintaining pressure on authorities for more aggressive stimulus measures and reforms to secure the nation’s long-term growth potential, the news outlet said.
Despite some positive signs on the consumption side, economic indicators overall suggest that Chinese consumers remain cautious.
”Overall, both production and consumption data from February suggest that both corporates and consumers stay cautious,” Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, told the Financial Times.

The Barrel Room on Canal in Canal Fulton is usually closed on Mondays. But owner Keri Sullivan is planning to open for the solar eclipse on April 8.
Ohio is a hot ticket for the April 8 solar eclipse, with the state expected to attract anywhere from 139,000 to 556,000 visitors inside the line of totality, according to estimates from the website GreatAmericanEclipse.com.
As people arrive, there will be significant demand for lodging, food and entertainment.
”It’s a big event. There’s nothing bigger really,” said Brent Sohngen , professor of agricultural, environmental, and development economics at Ohio State University. ”I don’t think you can overemphasize that.”
Hotels are already filling up with reservations, and businesses are looking to take advantage. Cedar Point is even opening up early for one day only to observe the eclipse.
Those visiting the Buckeye State are in addition to the 7,275,000 people who live within the path of totality in Ohio.
A map shows where totality can be experienced in Ohio during the April 8, 2024, solar eclipse.
”We are doing some tracking on this with hotels that are in the path of the eclipse and there definitely is increased demand, especially along the center line and in areas of bigger population,” said Joe Savarise, president and CEO of the Ohio Hotel & Lodging Association .
Ohio hotels are booking up fast for April’s solar eclipse
In Stark County, over 70% of hotel rooms tracked by Visit Canton are booked for the eclipse. Meanwhile, visitors bureaus in Summit and Cuyahoga County said hotels are experiencing high demand, particularly for the night before the eclipse.
Savarise said there are 700 hotels in the state that are within the path of totality in Ohio. An additional 731 hotels are in areas of the partial solar eclipse. There are also a number of campgrounds and other rentals such as Airbnbs and VRBOs.
”What we encourage people to do is No. 1, search for and book your room as quickly as you can because every day availability gets tighter and tighter,” he said. ”Also, there definitely are some parts of the state where there is higher demand right now, but not far away from there, still in really good viewing areas, there might be more availability in towns along the path.”
The Ohio Hotel & Lodging Association has been preparing for the eclipse since before 2023. Savarise said the event is an economic opportunity.
What’s the economic impact of the eclipse on Ohio?
In an email, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Development said the average visitor to Ohio spends $174 per visit. Considering visitation estimates from GreatAmericanEclipse.com, this could mean an economic boost of anywhere from $24 million to almost $100 million statewide.
”I don’t think that’s a stretch at all. People will be coming in, staying overnight, taking advantage of local attractions, restaurants, buying gas, shopping while they’re here, it’s just exponential,” Savarise said.
If Ohio follows the trend of states impacted by the 2017 total eclipse, the impact could actually gross in the low billions, Sohngen said.
After the 2017 total solar eclipse, the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism estimated the state brought in $269 million in economic impact, about 0.1% of the state’s gross domestic product.
If Ohio were to have the same 0.1% impact, it would amount to $822 million, but Sohngen said it could be even more.
”[In 2017,] some states in the South had it up to 0.25% of total GDP,” he said. ”You would expect a lot of people from Pennsylvania, Illinois, etc., to come over here, so my guess is $1 to $2 billion range potentially.”
A total solar eclipse hasn’t occurred in Ohio in over 200 years, and factors like weather could change the outcome.
Barrel Room owner Keri Sullivan: ’It’s a really big deal’
Many businesses in Northeast Ohio are planning for eclipse visitors by having events or selling limited edition products.
The Barrel Room on Canal, a restaurant in Canal Fulton, will be opening on an off day to host a solar eclipse watch party.
”We’re usually closed on Mondays but we’re opening up because it’s said that we’re going to have one of the best views,” owner Keri Sullivan said.
The restaurant will be open 2 to 9 p.m. and will offer eclipse-themed cocktail and food specials.
”We’re trying to cash in on something pretty cool that isn’t going to happen again anytime soon,” Sullivan said.
She said the event has generated decent interest on Facebook, but she isn’t sure what to expect yet.
”This is kind of unprecedented territory for us,” Sullivan said.
Rubber City Clothing creates special eclipse T-shirt
For Kevin Friend, owner of Rubber City Clothing Co. in Akron, making and selling an eclipse design for T-shirts, hoodies and bags was a no-brainer.
”We had been talking about it and a lady came in and asked if we had a design. That was good enough for me to decide that we should take advantage of this,” he said. ”Summit County is doing all kinds of stuff around it, the schools are closed, it’s a really big deal.”"
2024-03-01 11:15:00,Advancing The Circular Economy Beyond COP28: Moving From Plans To Action," Carmen Ene is the CEO of BNP Paribas 3 Step IT, one of Europe’s leading circular technology management providers. 
getty 
The world is drowning in waste. In the U.S., food waste is estimated at up to 40% of the supply. The EU generates 12.6 million tons of textile waste per year, and international e-waste is expected to reach 74 million tonnes by 2030—equivalent to around 200 Empire State Buildings—with dire consequences for the planet and all living beings. 
However, waste is far from being just an environmental emergency. It’s a socioeconomic one, too. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recently stated that between 2.9 and 12.9 million women who work in the informal waste sector are potentially exposing themselves and their unborn children to toxic residue. And, if we look at e-waste, only less than 20% of it is collected and recycled, with a loss of up to $57 billion worth of raw materials. 
It’s therefore not surprising that the circular economy—a system designed to minimize waste by keeping existing materials in circulation—is emerging as a tantalizing opportunity to tackle multiple socioeconomic and environmental issues simultaneously. 
However, the greater question is whether a global system built for centuries on the principles of “take, make and waste” can truly transform into a circular, resource-efficient one. 
Spotlight On Europe 
Over the last decade, the EU has been a leading force in advancing the circular economy worldwide, and its focus on circularity is driven by the synergy of benefits it can offer. 
Yet, with virtually all countries grappling to secure supplies of raw materials, find meaningful work for their populations, prevent the devastating impacts of global warming and keep their economies going, Europe is not alone on its circularity journey. In September, the EU commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevičius, visited China to renew the commitment to a cooperation road map on a circular economy, expected to be rolled out in 2024. Other countries, such as The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the U.S., are also advancing their circularity agenda 
A Balancing Act 
The increasing global emphasis on circularity is positive, and it offers an example of the systemic change needed to establish a worldwide route toward a just and sustainable future. 
However, the transition is still very much in its infancy. Even in the EU, where circular economy adoption is very advanced, “more than 87 percent of … resource consumption still comes from primary materials,” according to the World Bank. It’s also apparent that circularity alone is not enough. Broader systemic changes are needed to establish a cohesive, worldwide route toward a just and sustainable future. 
At the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), negotiations were long and politically complex, but they were also fruitful, reaching a momentous agreement that signals the “beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.” The deal also laid the ground “for a swift, just and equitable transition, underpinned by deep emissions cuts and scaled-up finance.” 
Notably, for the first time, the circular economy was included in the negotiated outcomes text, which explicitly mentioned circular approaches as part of the system change needed to address climate change. 
A Blueprint For Change 
With COP28 and the first-ever global stocktake behind us (even though the world did not turn the page on climate change), it feels like we finally stand at the brink of a pivotal transformation with all nations recognizing the urgent need to accelerate global action. 
When it comes to national and international frameworks and plans, the effectiveness of an agreement lies in its practical enforcement. Without solutions that make it practically and economically possible for citizens and businesses to play their part, ideas will remain empty promises. 
That’s where the circular economy comes to the fore. While not a silver bullet, it offers a comprehensive framework to initiate meaningful progress by delivering tangible results like creating cost efficiencies for businesses, supporting the creation of up to 8 million new jobs, unlocking over $4.5 trillion of economic growth, improving the resilience of global supply chains and allowing us to fulfill people’s needs with only 70% of the materials we now extract and use. 
Importantly, even though adoption is not yet widespread, solutions based on circular economy principles already exist in multiple sectors and are often easy and financially and operationally convenient to adopt. 
From Talk To Action 
To make progress on the circular transition will require a knuckling down. Europe and the other circularly advanced economies will need to work together to create a level-playing field for circular business models to compete fairly with linear ones, enhancing competitiveness and encouraging widespread adoption. 
A fair and effective global circular economy will depend on transparent and sustainable supply chains. This means businesses will need the policies and tools to make the right choices when it comes to their partnerships, investment, and impact, and governments will need to invest in the systems that allow products to be designed, sold, returned, repaired and remanufactured across borders. 
Providers of circular solutions will need to dedicate time and effort to better communicate the commercial and operational benefits of these products. Circularity is not yet mainstream, after all, and marketing circular offerings requires leaders to focus on getting the message through that the advantages of circularity go beyond the environmental ones. 
If we act now, by the time the next COP comes along, we won’t just have made significant progress on energy—starting to tackle the 55% of global emissions related to that sector—but we’ll have begun to finally confront the remaining 45%, which is linked to the way we make and consume products. 
Crucially, we will have started building a world where assets are reused, waste is managed responsibly, circular solutions empower people across communities and economic prosperity goes together with environmental health. I believe this is the optimal path to a secure and thriving future."

New Mountain Finance Corporation isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here). 
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the New Mountain Finance Corporation’s Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to John Kline, President and CEO, New Mountain Finance Corporation. Please go ahead, sir. 
John Kline: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to New Mountain Finance Corporation’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. On the line with me here today are Steve Klinsky, Chairman of NMFC and CEO of New Mountain Capital; and Laura Holson, COO and Interim CFO of NMFC; and Kris Corbett, CFO and Treasurer of NMFC. We are pleased to officially welcome Kris, who joins us from Blackstone Credit, where he was Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Blackstone’s BDCs. Steve is going to make some introductory remarks, but before he does, I’d like to ask Kris to make some important statements regarding today’s call. 
Kris Corbett: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the presentation, I would like to advise everyone that today’s call and webcast are being recorded. Please note that, they are the property of New Mountain Finance Corporation and that any unauthorized broadcast in any form is strictly prohibited.

I would also like to call your attention to the customary safe harbor disclosure in our press release and on Page 2 of the slide presentation regarding forward-looking statements. Today’s conference call and webcast may include forward-looking statements projections, and we ask that you refer to our most recent filings with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements and projections. 
We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements or projections unless required to by law. To obtain copies of our latest SEC filings and to access the slide presentation that we will be referencing throughout this call, please visit our website at www.newmountainfinance.com. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Steve Klinsky, NMFC’s Chairman, who will give some highlights beginning on Page 5 of the slide presentation. Steve? 
Steve Klinsky: Thanks, Kris. It’s great to be able to address you all today, both as NMFC’s Chairman and as a major fellow shareholder. Fourth quarter financial results were in line with preliminary estimates released in January. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $0.40 per share, more than covering our $0.32 per share regular dividend that was paid in cash on December 29th. Our earnings increased by $0.05 compared to Q4 of last year and were in line with Q3. Our net asset value per share decreased slightly to $12.87, a $0.09 decline compared to last quarter, excluding the impact of the $0.10 special dividend paid on December 29th, demonstrating continued stable credit performance across our portfolio. Given our earnings of $0.40 per share this quarter, we will make our fourth consecutive variable supplemental dividend payment. 
The variable supplemental dividend for this quarter will be $0.04 per share, which is equal to half of the amount of our Q4 quarterly earnings in excess of our regular dividend of $0.32. NMFC will pay these distributions on March 29th to holders of record as of March 15th. The remainder of the excess earnings will remain on our balance sheet and maybe paid out in the future. For the year, we generated total dividends of $1.53 per share, inclusive of the $0.10 special distribution paid in Q4 that was a result of realized gains from our investment in Haven Midstream Holdings. These cumulative dividends represent an annual distribution yield of over 12%. Looking forward to Q1, in addition to our regular $0.32 dividend, we expect to generate a variable supplemental dividend of at least $0.02 per share payable in the second quarter of 2024. 
This incremental payout is supported by expected strong credit performance and continued elevated base rates, which continue to be a substantial positive for our quarterly earnings. Subsequent to year end, on February 1st, the company issued a $300 million five year investment-grade bond with very strong execution for NMFC’s first issuance of this kind. We would like to thank those investors, who participated in the offering and we remain focused on accessing this market for future liquidity needs. We believe the strength of New Mountain and of NMFC is driven by the quality of our team. New Mountain overall now numbers 245 members and the firm has developed specialties in attractive defensive growth that is a cyclical growth sectors such as life science supplies, healthcare information technology, software, infrastructure services and digital engineering. 
When pursuing our credit investing efforts, we utilize our extensive group of industry experts to provide unique knowledge and expertise that allows us to make very-informed, high-conviction underwriting decisions. Over the last year, we have continued to expand the quality of our team. New Mountain’s private equity funds have never had a bankruptcy or missed an interest payment and the firm now manages over $50 billion of assets. Similarly, NMFC has experienced only three basis points of average annualized net realized losses in its nearly 13 years as a public company. We believe our loans are well-positioned overall in defensive growth industries that we think are right in all times and particularly attractive in less certain economic times. 
Finally, we as management continue as major shareholders of NMFC. Senior management and employee share ownership has been rising over time and we now own approximately 13% of NMFC’s total shares personally. With that, let me turn the call to John. 
John Kline: Thank you, Steve. I would like to begin by offering some more details on our direct-lending investment strategy and track record. Starting on Page 8, we highlight our disciplined industry selection, which shows exposure to a diversified list of defensive non-cyclical sectors. These sectors and industry niches are characterized by durable growth drivers, predictable revenue streams, margin stability and great free cash flow conversion. We have successfully avoided cyclical, volatile and secularly challenged industries, which could be riskier areas to invest, given today’s higher rate environment. Our strategy has been consistent over our nearly 13 years as a public company and it allows us to operate with confidence in any economic environment. 
Page 9 provides a high level snapshot of our business, where we show a long-term track record of delivering consistent enhanced yield to our shareholders by minimizing credit losses and distributing virtually all of our excess income to shareholders. Since our IPO in 2011, NMFC has returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through our dividend program, generating an annualized return of approximately 10%. Our current portfolio invests in companies within high-quality industries that are performing well and where our last dollar of risk is approximately 40% of the purchase price paid for the business. We lend primarily to businesses owned by financial sponsors, who are sophisticated and supportive owners with significant capital that is junior to the loans that we make. 
Turning to Page 10. The internal risk ratings of our portfolio improved quarter-over-quarter, with 95% of our portfolio rated green compared to 93% last quarter. Our most challenged names within the orange and red categories represent less than 2% of NMFC’s fair value and we have derisked our book by marking our red names to 13% of face value and our orange names to 69% of face value. At these valuation levels, our weaker names do not represent material future downside risk to our book value. The updated heat map is shown in its entirety on Page 11. Given our portfolio’s orientation towards defensive sectors like software, business services and healthcare, we believe our assets are well-positioned to continue to perform no matter how the economic landscape develops. 
Overall, we had positive credit migration in the quarter with one exception related to a small position in Careismatic Brands, a medical apparel distributor, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after quarter end. From Q3 to Q4, this position declined in value by $13 million and is currently marked at $1 million of fair value. Positive credit developments include the full repayment at par of EaglePicher’s second lien during Q4, which was previously a yellow named marked at $0.70 and the full repayment at par during Q1 of our $37.5 million second lien position in Franklin Energy, a yellow rated name marked at $0.91 as of 12/31. Additionally, two companies moved from yellow to green during Q4 as a result of improved performance. As these pay downs and material positive credit movements demonstrate, we continue to believe that many of our non-green names have the ability to migrate back to green over time. 
Turning to Page 12, we provide a graphical analysis of NAV changes during the quarter. Starting on the left, credit specific movements represented a $0.24 decrease in book value, the majority of which was is represented by Careismatic Brands. Broad credit market movements were a $0.15 book value tailwind as credit spreads tightened during Q4 due to generally strong market conditions while excess earnings, the aforementioned special dividend and other items, bridge us to the $12.87 book value as of 12/31. Page 13 addresses NMFC’s non-accrual performance. On the left side of the page, we show the current state of the portfolio where we have $3 billion of investments at fair value with $52 million or 1.7% of the portfolio currently on non-accrual. 
In Q4 Transcendia an orange name with a fair value of just $7 million was placed on non-accrual. While our investment in Ancira was realized leaving us with six companies on non-accrual. Of the names are non-accrual, most are from much older vintages have been written down materially and have a good chance of exiting the portfolio in the medium term. On the right side of the page, we show our cumulative credit performance since IPO, where NMFC has made $9.3 billion of investments while realizing only, while realizing losses of only $26 million. This represents an annualized net loss rate of approximately three basis points since IPO. This is consistent with our value proposition of preserving principal value and distributing nearly all of our net investment income through predictable quarterly dividends. 
A chemist in a laboratory mixing specialty chemicals and materials for research. 
On Page 14, we present NMFC’s overall economic performance since IPO showing that we have delivered consistent and compelling returns. Cumulatively, NMFC has earned $1.2 billion in net investment income while generating only $26 million of cumulative net realized losses and only $60 million of net unrealized depreciation netting to over $1.1 billion of value created for shareholders. Page 15 shows a stock chart detailing NMFC’s equity return since IPO, over this period NMFC has generated a compound annual return of approximately 10%, which represents a very strong cash flow oriented return well in excess of both the high yield index and an index of BDC peers who have been public at least as long as we have. I’ll now turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Laura Holson, to discuss current portfolio construction. 
Laura Holson: Thanks John. We continue to believe the outlook for 2024 in the sponsor-backed direct lending market is positive. Deal flow continues to be episodic, but there are pockets of activity in our defensive growth verticals where we have the opportunity to make loans at attractive yields, while remaining very selective. Deal structures remain compelling with leverage meaningfully below peak levels and significant sponsor equity contributions representing the vast majority of the capital structures. We remain bullish on the medium and long-term outlook for M&A activity, given the magnitude of dry powder for private equity and the ongoing need to return capital to LPs, as well as more attractive financing markets for borrowers and the expectation for rate cuts. 
Syndicated loan and high-yield markets have reopened and we have seen modest spread compression related to the increased competition for fewer opportunities. However, we expect the supply demand imbalance to normalize as soon as we see a more regular deal flow environment return. Despite the reopening of the syndicated markets, the direct lending market generally remains the financing market of choice for sponsors as the majority of sponsors still recognize the benefits of the direct lending solution, including more certain execution, more flexibility around creating a bespoke capital structure, and the ability to hand select lenders. In addition to new activity, our large portfolio of over 100 unique borrowers provides an ongoing opportunity set to make incremental loans to existing well-performing portfolio companies seeking to pursue accretive M&A. 
Page 17 presents an interest rate analysis that provides insight into the effective base rates on NMFC’s earnings. As a reminder, the NMFC loan portfolio is 88% floating rate and 12% fixed rate, while our liabilities are 59% fixed rate and 41% floating rate as of year-end. Moving on to Page 18, in Q4, we saw an uptick in portfolio velocity. We originated $142 million of assets, offset by $257 million of repayments and sales, as we continued to modestly delever towards the middle of our 1x to 1.25x debt-to-equity range. Our originations consisted of investments in our core defensive growth power alleys, such as veterinary services, enterprise software and infrastructure products. I’d highlight that four of our repayments were second lien positions and we have line of sight into a few additional second lien repayments, as the portfolio continues to migrate more senior over time. 
Turning to Page 19, we show our asset mix where approximately 68% of our investments, inclusive of first lien, SLPs, and net lease are senior in nature. As I mentioned, this continues to skew more senior over time. Second lien positions decreased from 17% last quarter to 15% this quarter. Our second lien exposure is largely a function of the length of our operating history. As a reminder, our credit business began in 2008, when private equity firms primarily financed their buyouts with first lien, second lien capital structures. Overtime, this has largely been replaced by the unitranche structure, and as a result, we expect the percentage of first lien and unitranche in our portfolio to continue to increase over time, as long as the unitranche structure remains the preferred solution by sponsors. 
Approximately 8% of the portfolio is comprised of our equity positions, the largest of which are shown on the right side of the page. As mentioned in prior quarters, we hope to monetize certain of these equity positions in the medium-term and rotate those dollars into cash yielding assets. Page 20 shows that the average yield of NMFC’s portfolio has decreased from 11.8% in Q3 to 10.9% for Q4, primarily due to the downward shift in the base rate curve. Generally speaking, even though spreads are tighter, yields remain attractive and support our net investment income target. Page 21 highlights the scale and credit trends of our underlying borrowers. As you can see, the weighted average EBITDA of our borrowers has increased over the last several quarters to $155 million. 
This is primarily attributable to sequential EBITDA growth at the individual companies we lend to and to a lesser extent, portfolio churn. While we first and foremost concentrate on how an opportunity maps against our defensive growth criteria and internal New Mountain knowledge, we believe that larger borrowers tend to be marginally safer, all else included. We also show the relevant leverage and interest coverage stats across the portfolio. Portfolio company leverage has decreased slightly over the last two quarters. Loan to values continue to be quite compelling, and the current portfolio has an average loan to value of 42%. Interest coverage ratios have stabilized as expected, and the weighted average interest coverage on the portfolio was flat at 1.5x this quarter. 
We’ve seen sponsors continue to proactively support company liquidity and continued M&A activity. This is a great indication that our portfolio consists of companies that are performing well and are able to attract additional investment healthy valuations. Finally, as illustrated on Page 22, we have a diversified portfolio across 111 portfolio companies. The top 15 investments inclusive of our SLP funds and net lease account for approximately 43% of total fair value and represent our highest conviction names. I’ll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kris Corbett, to discuss our financial results. 
Kris Corbett: Thank you, Laura. For more details, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K that was filed yesterday with the SEC. As shown on Slide 23, the portfolio had approximately $3 billion in investments at fair value on December 31st, and total assets of $3.2 billion with total liabilities of $1.8 billion, of which total statutory debt outstanding was $1.5 billion, excluding $300 million of drawn SBA-guaranteed debentures. Net asset value of $1.3 billion or $12.87 per share was down slightly compared to the prior quarter. At quarter end, our statutory debt to equity ratio was 1.14x to 1x and 1.10x to 1x net of available cash on the balance sheet consistent with the balance sheet de-leveraging mentioned previously. 
On slide 24, we show out quarterly income statement results. For the current quarter, we earned total investment income of $92.8 million, a 77% increase over prior year. Total net expenses were approximately $52.1 million, a 2% increase over prior year. As a reminder, the investment advisor has committed to a management fee of 1.25% for the 2024 calendar year. The investment advisor has also pledged to reduce its incentive fee if and as needed during this period to fully support the $0.32 per share regular quarterly dividend. Based on our forward view of the earnings power of the business, we do not expect to use this pledge. It is important to note that the investment advisor cannot recoup fees previously waived. Our adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $0.40 per weighted average share, which meaningfully exceeded our Q4 regular dividend of $0.32 per share. 
Our investment in Ancira, which had been previously marked down over prior periods was exited during the fourth quarter crystallizing a realized loss. Consistent with our prior practices, we elected to rebate our shareholders $1.3 million of incentive fees related to PIK income accrued from Ancira which resulted in a $0.01 per share increase to our NII for the quarter. As shown on Slide 25, we earned total investment income of $373.8 million for the year, which represents an increase of 23% over the prior year. Total net expenses of $214.9 million increased 21% over prior year. As Slide 26 demonstrates, 97% of our total investment income is recurring this quarter, given the minimal fees earned in Q4. You will see historically that, over 90% of our quarterly income is recurring in nature and on average, over 80% of our income is regularly paid in cash. 
We believe this consistency shows the stability and predictability of our investment income. Importantly, over 99% of our quarterly non-cash income is generated from our green rated names. Turning to Slide 27. The red line shows the coverage of our regular dividend. This quarter adjusted net investment income exceeded our Q4 regular dividend by $0.08 per share. For Q1, 2024 our Board of Directors has again declared a regular dividend of $0.32 per share as well as a supplemental dividend of $0.04 per share. On Slide 28, we highlight our various financing sources and diversified leverage profile. Taking into account SBA-guaranteed debentures, we have $2.6 billion of total borrowing capacity with $768 million available on our revolving lines subject to borrowing base limitations. 
As a reminder, covenants under both our Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank credit facilities are generally tied to operating performance of the underlying businesses that we lend to, rather than the marks of our investments at any given time, which we think is particularly important during more volatile times. Finally, on Slide 29, we show our leverage maturity schedule. Over the last four months, we’ve had a number of positive developments with respect to our liabilities and liquidity profile, including successfully extending both our Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank credit facilities, doubling and extending our management company revolver and issuing over $400 million of unsecured notes including a Baby Bond and our first investment grade bond. As a result, nearly 70% of our debt matures in or after 2027. 
In the future, we plan to be repeat issuers in the investment grade markets to further ladder our maturities in the most cost-efficient manner. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to John. 
John Kline: Thank you, Kris. As we look forward to the rest of 2024, we remain confident in the continued strong performance of NMFC’s portfolio and believe we are on-track to continue to deliver great risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. We once again would like to thank all of our stakeholders for the ongoing partnership and support and look forward to maintaining our dialogue throughout the year. I will now turn it back to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator?

“The interest of a very active regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority,
suggests that the days of F&I being a very significant profit generator for car
dealers are numbered. A business model which once meant some dealer groups

“Whatever the changes ahead for providers of F&I, they can be sure that loyal

+0.52%
The growth rate of the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter was downgraded slightly to a 3.2% annual pace, but the economy is still expanding at a rapid clip and showing few signs of slowing down.
Originally the government said gross domestic product had expanded at a 3.3% rate in the final three months of 2023. The figure is adjusted for inflation.
The increase in fourth-quarter GDP followed an even stronger 4.9% gain in the third quarter. The economy does not appear to have lost a step early in the new year, either.
The latest forecasts suggest the U.S. is expanding at a rate of over 3% in the first quarter. The economy’s top sustainable speed in the long run is generally seen at around 1.8%.
What makes the recent strength even more remarkable is that it has taken place despite the sharply higher interest rates orchestrated by the Federal Reserve to tame in high inflation.
Big picture: The economy has weathered higher interest rates largely due to strong consumer spending that’s been underpinned by a muscular labor market.
Americans have been able to keep spending because they feel secure in their jobs. Higher spending in turn has negated the need for businesses to lay off lots of workers.
The prospect of the Fed cutting rates later in the year if inflation continues to wane is also acting as a strong tailwind.
Key details: Consumer spending, the main engine of the economy, was revised up to show a 3% increase in the fourth quarter instead of 2.8%.
Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
Overall business investment, the next largest peg of the economy, was weaker than originally reported.
Total spending rose just 09.%, compared with the initial 2.1% estimate, because of a decline in investment in new equipment.
Companies also rebuilt inventories at a slower pace than the initial GDP report showed. These are goods that have been produced but not sold yet.
Slower inventory growth largely accounted for the small reduction in headline GDP.
Inflation using the personal-consumption expenditure, or PCE, price index rose at a mild 1.8% annual rate in the fourth quarter, up a tick from the prior estimate.
The more closely followed core rate was also raised a notch to 2.1% — leaving it near the Fed’s 2% inflation goal.
The central bank aims to get the rate of inflation down to 2% for the full year.
Most other figures in the report were little changed. GDP is updated twice after its initial publication.
Looking ahead: “This all points to more domestic demand growth than previously thought and a hotter economy in general,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. 
Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and S&P 500 SPX fell in Wednesday trading.

2024-02-28 14:08:49,TradeXBank seeks commodity finance growth with chief executive hire,"Zurich-based commodity trade finance lender TradeXBank, formed in 2022 after the
sale of sanctions-hit Sberbank’s Swiss subsidiary, has announced the hire of
Camille Sednaoui as chief executive.

Sednaoui boasts more than three decades in transaction commodity finance, and
joins from Crédit Agricole, where he headed the bank’s international trade and
transaction banking department in Switzerland.

TradeXBank says he is tasked with executing its strategic growth plans and
establishing its presence in the commodity trade finance market.

“There is high demand in the market for an agile Swiss bank like TradeXBank,
that is serving its clients with bespoke solutions,” Sednaoui says. “We are
committed to further grow the business without compromising risk and
compliance.”

Bank chairman Christian Luescher, a veteran lawyer and former Swiss
parliamentarian, adds the appointment will help “re-establish our bank as a
strong player in the market”.

TradeXBank started life in September 2022 after the acquisition of Sberbank
Switzerland by m3 Groupe, which has operations in real estate, healthcare and
hospitality.

Swiss authorities temporarily halted certain sanctions requirements to
facilitate the sale, with TradeXBank taking over the banking licence previously
held by the Russian-owned lender.

Although clients withdrew around CHF1.5bn in assets prior to the acquisition, it
retained between CH600mn (US$681mn) and CHF700mn on hand and benefited from a
CHF500mn equity injection from m3 Groupe, making it one of the 20 largest Swiss
banks, executives said at the time.

Its focus is on financing trade in energy, metals, agricultural goods and
fertilisers.

TradeXBank’s progress contrasts with that of Amsterdam Trade Bank, a one-time
trade finance specialist that was considered a solvent and healthy business
until sanctions were imposed on its Russian parent company, Alfa Bank.

With counterparties no longer able to do business with the bank, it was placed
into the hands of bankruptcy trustees by a Dutch court in April 2022.

The anchor finance event of the Hong Kong Green Week was the Climate Business Forum: Asia Pacific (CBF), co-hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the International Finance Corporation.  It was kicked off on 26 February and attracted more than 400 participants, including top decision makers in global business and finance, to discuss solutions to unlock climate financing in the Asia Pacific.  The two-day event covered a broad range of topics including the energy transition, decarbonisation of heavy industries, the circular economy, the future of sustainable finance, and new climate technologies in emerging and developing markets in the Asia Pacific. 
Riding on the CBF, institutions from the public and private sector organised more than ten roundtables, seminars, and networking events focusing on themes such as climate finance, carbon markets, electric vehicle supply chain, net-zero transition financing, green classification framework, and financing green development in the Belt and Road region.  In addition, the HKMA and the International Monetary Fund co-hosted the Asia Climate Finance Roundtable on 29 February, which explored the key steps to scale up climate finance and the role of central banks and regulators in managing climate risks.
The events this week provided a platform for industry participants to spur new business development, facilitate knowledge exchange and networking opportunities, and promote collaboration across the public and private sectors to meet the Asia Pacific region’s climate financing challenges.
The Hong Kong Green Week – Finance Stream is part of the HKMA’s broader efforts to promote and enrich the green and sustainable ecosystem in Hong Kong.  During the autumn of 2024, the HKMA and the Dubai Financial Services Authority will also co-host the Joint Climate Finance Conference in Hong Kong, which will explore common opportunities and challenges in accelerating the flow of transition financing in the Middle East and Asia."

Though there is no shortage of millionaires who got a significant amount of help from their family’s wealth, there’s also a fair amount of millionaires who build their fortunes all on their own.
Try This: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)
But self-made millionaires didn’t just magically slide into a massive net worth. They put in hard work to advance in their fields and make money that can all but guarantee a financially secure future — as long as they manage their fortunes wisely. One way these highly successful high earners get and stay rich is by staying informed and motivated. This means hitting the finance books.
But which finance books do self-made millionaires treasure the most? GOBankingRates consulted two self-made millionaires to get the scoop on their top fave reads — and what makes these literary works so impactful.

‘The Wealthy Barber’ by David Chilton
David Delisle , an author and self-made millionaire who began investing at the age of 11 and became semi-retired at age 40, pointed to a book that inspired him to build wealth as a kid called “The Wealthy Barber” by David Chilton.
“This is one of the first books I ever read about money, and I read it when I was 10,” Delisle said. “What I love about this book is how easy it was to read, even as a child. It’s written as a fun story with a local unassuming barber that has achieved financial freedom and then doles out a little wisdom during every haircut. This is when I first learned the power of compound growth, and that one lesson alone changed my relationship with money.”

‘The Psychology of Money’ by Morgan Housel
Looking to learn how money works on a mental and emotional level so as to remain clear headed about your financial path and goals? Consider “The Psychology of Money” by Morgan Housel.

“This is an amazing book that tackles the psychology of money in a very simple and easily understandable way,” Delisle said. “What stands out to me is how he gives examples of how easy it is to fall into the trap of never having enough. This is very similar to the movement I’m hoping to inspire to break that same cycle of endlessly chasing more.”
‘The Richest Man in Babylon’ by George Samuel Clason
“This is a classic book that was written in 1926,” Delisle said. “What I love the most about this book is how the core principles of wealth haven’t changed over the past 100 years. All of the trends and fads come and go, but these core principles remain the same. For example, the term ‘pay yourself first’ is a core concept that I use and is a habit that is still the best way for most people to save.”
‘Think and Grow Rich’ by Napoleon Hill
Self-made millionaire Luke Lintz, CEO, entrepreneur and social media expert at HighKey Agency , said this book holds a special plate in his heart.
“This timeless masterpiece delves into the power of manifestation and intentionality in goal-setting, guiding readers through the process of reverse engineering their aspirations into tangible, achievable steps,” Lintz said. “Its profound teachings have guided my journey toward personal and financial growth, empowering me to envision my dreams and diligently work toward their realization.”
‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ by Robert T. Kiyosaki
If you’ve ever browsed or delved into personal finance or business literature, you’ve surely heard of this groundbreaking work.
“This book was introduced to me during my formative years in grade 9 [and] fundamentally reshaped my understanding of money,” Lintz said. “Contrasting the perspectives, mentalities and values of a rich dad versus a poor dad provided invaluable insights into the dynamics of wealth accumulation. Witnessing this stark comparison allowed me to reflect on my own upbringing and familial influences, leading to profound realizations about money management and financial mindset.”
‘From Blue to Digital Gold’ by Paul Alex Espinoza
“This book offers invaluable entrepreneurship and digital marketing lessons and delves into the mindset shifts necessary for achieving financial success,” Lintz said. “‘From Blue to Digital Gold’ provides a roadmap for building wealth and emphasizes the importance of resilience, adaptability and continuous learning. Paul’s insights into leveraging personal experiences and skills for entrepreneurial success resonate deeply and have played a pivotal role in shaping my own approach to wealth building.”

2024-03-01 14:47:24,"I flew on Finnair""s Airbus A350 between New York and Helsinki in economy. It""s now one of my go-to airlines for crossing the Atlantic.","I was not expecting to be so comfortable on Finnair, but the upgraded economy product offered surprisingly well-padded seats and tasty food.
      I flew on Finnair's A350 from New York to Helsinki and loved the experience.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI recently flew between New York and Helsinki on Finnair's Airbus A350-900 in economy.I found the recently upgraded seats extremely comfortable and the meals filling and tasty.Finnair is now my go-to for long-haul flying despite an inconsistent weight policy for carry-ons.I recently traveled all the way from New York City to Finland's northernmost municipality of Utsjoki for a chance to see the aurora lights.When researching flights, I quickly realized Finland's flag carrier, Finnair, is really the only good option leaving NYC that doesn't require an overnight layover or more than two plane rides to get to Lapland.The nearly $1,000 roundtrip economy fare was several hundred dollars more expensive than the cheaper Scandinavian Airlines (which required two stops), but I'm happy I spent the extra money.Granted, Finnair proved to have a stricter-than-expected bag weight policy, but I'd easily book the airline again for long-haul flying.My Northern Lights tour was in Utsjoki, Finland, and Finnair was the easiest option for getting there.I finally checked the northern lights off my bucket list.Aurora HolidaysThe tiny village sits within the Finnish Lapland, which is in the Arctic Circle. I successfully saw the lights with the help of a tour company called Aurora Holidays.I had never flown on Finnair before last month and was eager to try a new airline, which offered a one-stop from NYC to Lapland via Helsinki.Finnair is part of the Oneworld alliance.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderMy entire itinerary was New York-JFK nonstop to Helsinki, where I got a connection to Ivalo, Finland.I then drove two hours to Utsjoki in the Arctic Circle, which was a crisp -8°F during my first night there.My trip started at New York-JFK's Terminal 8, where the international Oneworld alliance has congregated.Oneworld partner Qatar Airways' check-in counter at New York-JFK's Terminal 8, taken during Christmas last year.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderOneworld members American Airlines and British Airways became ""roommates"" in late 2022 when both consolidated operations at JFK's T8 to streamline their partnership.Other alliance partners, Finnair, Qatar Airways, Spanish flag carrier Iberia, and Japan Airlines, among others, also operate out of the terminal.While I only had a carry-on, I first went to Finnair's little check-in corner because I needed to add TSA PreCheck to my reservation.The economy check-in counter for Finnair at T8.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI forgot to include my KTN number when I checked in on the app, but it thankfully didn't take long to add it at the counter.I didn't realize this meant the agent would take the opportunity to weigh my carry-on. I knew there was a limit, and I quickly learned how strict.My combined bags (my suitcase and a backpack) weighed 9.6 kilograms.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderMy fare did not include a checked bag, only a carry-on and personal item that weighed no more than eight kilograms (about 17.6 pounds) combined.That is bumped up to 12 kilograms (about 26.5 pounds) for business class travelers.Both of my bags fit within the size dimensions, but they were about three and a half pounds overweight. The carry-on could be a maximum of 22in x 16in x 9in, while the personal item could be up to 16in x 12in x 6in, according to Finnair.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI've flown on many European carriers and know the bag weight limits, but I have never had them actually weighed before, so I typically just take my chances since I don't like to check a bag.I was slightly surprised about the strictness, but I was fully prepared to pay whatever fee — I'll never argue with the employee.The agent said I couldn't bring my carry-on but could check it for free. Not ideal, but I was just happy I didn't have to pay anything.Security took five minutes, thanks to TSA PreCheck. Looking back, though, I should have just left it alone.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThis was the only snafu I had with Finnair, but they didn't charge me.I'm 99.9% sure I didn't have a checked bag included in my fare, so I would say that's pretty good customer service.I could skip check-in counters on two of the three other Finnair flights, which seemed to help avoid it getting weighed again.Getting off the Finnair plane in Ivalo, Finland, which was a two-hour drive from my final destination of Utsjoki. Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI got my boarding pass on the app for both domestic flights and could skip the check-in desk. My bags weren't weighed at the gate, though, but I did see some people pulled aside to check the size of their carry-on.For my return flight to New York, I did have to go to the check-in counter to get my boarding pass in Helsinki. But the agent there didn't weigh my bags, so I'm unsure if the strict weight was just a New York thing.My flight to Helsinki was scheduled to leave at 10:55 p.m., and we started boarding about 45 minutes before departure. The same boarding schedule was experienced on the return flight.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI didn't have lounge access, so I killed time before the flight at Bobby Van's Grill in Terminal 8. I got a free $28 with my Priority Pass membership and used it for dinner and a beer.Certain loyalty members and business class passengers with access, however, can take advantage of the new co-branded Greenwich lounge offered by American and British in T8, according to Finnair.On both legs to and from Helsinki, I flew on Finnair's nine-year-old Airbus A350-900 aircraft, registered OH-LWA. The Finnair Airbus A350 at the gate in Helsinki.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderAccording to the aircraft-tracking website FlightAware, the widebody plane has been flying back and forth between New York-JFK and Helsinki for a few weeks now.The outbound was a red-eye and landed around 1:15 p.m. the next day. The return from Helsinki left at 4:55 p.m. and landed back at New York-JFK around 7 p.m. the same day.The plane has 251 economy seats. I prefer the aisle when flying long-haul and paid an extra $38 to reserve seat 33J in the last row of the section.The view from seat 33J.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderAlthough the proximity to the lavatories annoys many passengers, I don't mind the last row because I can recline my seat as far back as I want to without worrying about what the person behind me will do.This avoids the ""should you recline your seat"" game.One look, and I knew the seat would be comfortable. It looked well-padded with a headrest, seatback pocket, and big television.The seatback pocket wasn't huge.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThe seatback pocket had a small water bottle waiting for me, and it easily fit my own bottle and my Kindle, though there were a few other slots on the seatback for smaller items. I didn't have an issue organizing my things, and there was no annoying inflight entertainment box under the seat in front blocking my foot room.According to Finnair, it has recently upgraded its  A330 and A350 economy seats with memory foam cushions, and I could feel the difference.The seats were configured in a 3x3x3 layout.Taylor Rains/Business Insider""Memory foam is becoming more and more common in aircraft interiors and seating cushions,"" Finnair's senior manager for customer experience and design strategy, David Kondo, said in an October 2022 press release discussing the economy enhancements. ""It helps with posture and ergonomics support.""The new seats also feature 18 inches of width and 31 inches of pitch, which I think is easily enough legroom for my five-foot, three-inch tall self. Can you tell I have dogs?Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI'm short, so I don't need much space on airplanes. Finnair also has extra legroom seats in the economy section that cost more to reserve.There is also a 12-inch seatback screen with a USB port, though I noticed it did not adjust up or down when the seat in front was reclined.There was a lot to be explored as far as entertainment, but the lack of tilt could impact viewing.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThe television also had external cameras that showed the aircraft flying, as well as information about things like speed and altitude.Moreover, the service schedule was displayed on the home screen, including meal times, which I found helpful.Given this was a red-eye, I didn't spend too much time awake and took advantage of the seat's deep recline. The flight attendants asked people to sit upright during meal times.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThe flight had a strong tailwind that propelled us from New York to Helsinki in just seven and a half hours.The flight was on time to leave and landed half an hour early — and our gate was ready for us when we got there, thankfully.In fact, I slept for about six hours on the outbound. The recline, cushion, blanket, and headrest helped.Finnair did not provide a pillow.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI was not expecting to be so comfortable on Finnair, and the recline easily won brownie points.Plus, I didn't feel cramped when the person in front reclined, though I think it's most comfortable if everyone reclines during non-meal hours. This solves the TV and space issue.For the longer return journey, I did pay an extra $15 to reserve an ""economy comfort"" seat so I could experience both options.The economy plus seat on the return flight.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderSince I was flying on the same plane to and from Helsinki, I figured I'd try different seat locations. The extra legroom seat cost about $52.I often look to SeatGuru for advice on new carriers, and I saw the extra legroom seat of 22C was uniquely positioned without a seat in front.The unlimited legroom of seat 22C on Finnair's A350.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThe seat map shows row 21, an exit row in the front of the first economy section, with two seats. The row behind that has the standard three seats.However, only the two seats closest to the window are aligned, leaving the aisle in row 22 almost on an island.I didn't need the endless legroom, but I think this is a great seat option for people needing extra space.The aisle-side armrest could make someone feel cramped, however.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI did notice the flight attendants sometimes hit the seat when maneuvering their galley cart around me, but it wasn't bothersome.Passengers will give up a proper seatback screen and pocket, however. This was OK on my flight because the middle seat was open.There was a USB in my screen, but you can't use it during takeoff and landing, so I just used the middle seat's.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI used the middle seat as my storage space for my return flight, but if that spot is taken, then the aisle seat passenger will not have access to any pockets for things like a water bottle or headphones.Moreover, the tray table is in the armrest and the seatback screen must be stowed for takeoff and landing.Finnair provides wired headphones for the TV.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThe angle of the screen positioned up may be awkward for some travelers, but I didn't find it that bothersome.I didn't use it much, though, preferring to binge the Traitors UK on my Kindle instead.While Finnair's improved economy seats were particularly pleasing, I was more surprised by the quality of the food.The side dish on the outbound journey.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderBoth long-haul journeys offered one free meal an hour after takeoff and another drink service within the last two hours before landing.This was different from carriers, like United Airlines and Air Canada, which have offered me two meals between Europe and the US, including a lunch/dinner and breakfast.On the outbound, I had a beef dish with rice and veggies. Everything was very tasty.The main course on the outbound.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThe meat was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. I was also impressed with the flavorful veggies, which I typically find on airlines to be more bland.The return dinner of meatballs, mashed potatoes, and carrots was just as delicious.The meal on the return.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThe return was my favorite meal of the two, reminding me of a home-cooked meal. And the side of coleslaw, bread, and chocolate was nice and filling.I had soda and blueberry juice with my meals.While the food was great, I did notice a lack of choice. I ordered this unique blueberry juice with my meals. It was also served on the domestic flights.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI'm used to the flight attendants asking something along the lines of, ""Chicken or pasta?"" — but I was just handed a tray in Finnair's case.The airline does have special meals available, which I noticed were served first.Overall, I had no issues sleeping or getting comfortable in Finnair's A350 economy cabin thanks to the filling food and padded seats. The Finnair A350 economy cabin.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI wasn't expecting to enjoy Finnair's economy so much, and I could have easily survived several more hours onboard.Even the Airbus A321 flights between Helsinki and Ivalo were nice and comfortable.The views over Finland when flying from Helsinki to Ivalo.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderThe Airbus planes I flew on within Finland were fit with an all-economy cabin. The flights were only about an hour and a half, so we got a complimentary drink but no snack.I did appreciate the tray table having a little holder for a phone or tablet since the seats didn't have any inflight entertainment (though I didn't expect them to for such a short flight).In fact, I am planning a few trips to Europe this year that will require a one-stop, and I plan to book Finnair — even if its more expensive.The cabin of the Finnair A350.Taylor Rains/Business InsiderI plan to go to the Baltics in May and need to fly into Tallinn, Estonia, and out of Vilnius, Lithuania. There are no nonstops, but there are a few one-stop options from New York-JFK, including SAS, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss, and Finnair.Although Finnair is one of the more expensive options, I plan to book it again because I know the seats will be comfortable. Even if I'm on an Airbus A330 and not an A350, Finnair is upgrading all of its widebody cabins to the same design — making the consistency across its fleet even more favorable for customers.Read the original article on Business Insider.....»»"
2024-03-01 15:22:43,Arbitrum and Robinhood Partnership Ushers in New Era for Decentralized Finance Swaps," Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum has partnered up with trading app giant Robinhood to announce a new token swap integration in Robinhood’s self-custody wallet. 
The companies made the joint announcement yesterday at the ETHDenver conference. 
The new integration lets Robinhood Wallet users transact with Arbitrum. In the coming months, the two companies will provide support for several cross-chain token swaps that will tap the layer 2 for its cheap transaction costs and high speeds. 
Robinhood Wallet launched a year ago for iOS as a self-custodial wallet, meaning it lets users hold their own private keys. Its Android equivalent is still in beta and will full launch soon. 
The wallet currently supports payments on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism and Base networks. 
Robinhood’s General Manager Johann Kerbrat said in a press statement: “accessing and transacting on L2s has historically been difficult to non-crypto natives, but Robinhood Wallet now helps strip away the complexities to help onboard those new to web3.” 
A.J. Warner, the Chief Strategy Officer at Arbitrum developers Offchain Labs also said in the release: “As DeFi continues to lead on Arbitrum, we’ll now see one of the most recognizable trading platforms bring low-cost in-app swaps to a wide audience of traders.” 
Beyond Arbitrum, Robinhood Anticipates Further Adoption 
Robinhood clearly expects its crypto operations to expand further. In December, the popular trading app announced commission-free crypto trading for its EU customers. 
The company also leapt on the opportunities provided to it by the January 10 launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by listing all of them on its app. 
Earlier this month, Robinhood announced a partnership with Metamask. It gives US users the ability to directly purchase crypto on Robinhood through their Metamask apps. 
In an earnings call mid-February, the trading app declared its transactions-based revenues in Q4 2023 rose 8% compared to the same quarter the preceding year. The company attributed this to an uptick (10%) in cryptocurrencies revenue—$43 million in the quarter. 
This week Robinhood announced an NFT giveaway in collaboration with Notable.art. Robinhood Wallet users can participate to win exclusive art by American artist Hunt Slonem."

2024-03-01 00:00:00,Michelle W Bowman: Reflections on the economy and bank regulation," Speech by Ms Michelle W Bowman, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Florida Bankers Association Leadership Luncheon Events, Miami, Florida, 27 February 2024. 
I would like to thank the Florida Bankers Association and your new President and CEO, Kathy Kraninger, for the invitation to share my thoughts with you today. It is really a pleasure to join you here in Florida to discuss current trends in bank regulation, and to learn the issues on your mind, especially about the path of regulatory reform, and your views on local banking and economic conditions in the communities you serve. I find great value in spending time outside of Washington, D.C. These conversations provide valuable insights to inform my work at the Federal Reserve - both for my understanding of the economy and the banking environment. 
Before discussing bank regulation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and monetary policy. 
Monetary Policy 
Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our most recent meeting in January, we voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. 
We have seen progress on inflation over the past year, with the 12-month readings through December of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation both below 3 percent for the first time since the spring of 2021. However, the latest consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) inflation data through January suggest slower progress in bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target. Throughout this time, economic activity has remained strong with ongoing strength in consumer spending. We had also seen signs of the labor market coming into better balance, but recent strong jobs reports-including upward revisions to employment growth-show a continued tight labor market. Last year, the average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November, with the unemployment rate edging up to 3.7 percent. In recent months, however, job growth has rebounded and the labor force participation rate declined, retracing some of its earlier gains."

2024-03-01 08:45:34,Commonwealth Conversations: Federal Reserve's Tom Barkin Sheds Light on Fed's Role and the Economy,"Cliff Fleet interviews Tom Barkin, President and CEO of The Federal Reserve Bank
of Richmond, for The Greater Williamsburg Chamber of Commerce ”Commonwealth
Conversations” speaker series on Feb. 28 (Christopher Six/WYDaily)WILLIAMSBURG —
The Greater Williamsburg Chamber of Commerce learned about the role of the Fed
and the state of the economy from President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Richmond Tom Barkin during the latest installment of its ”Commonwealth
Conversations” speaker series Wednesday morning at Williamsburg Lodge.

The conversation was led by the President and CEO of the Colonial Williamsburg
Foundation, Cliff Fleet.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Barkin serves as a voting
member on the Fed’s chief monetary policy body, the Federal Open Market
Committee, and is also responsible for bank supervision and the Federal
Reserve’s technology organization. He is continually ”on the ground” in the
Fed’s Fifth District, it said, which covers South Carolina, North Carolina,
Virginia, D.C., West Virginia and Maryland.


Among its many duties, Barking said the Fed’s most important role is ”to
preserve liquidity in times of trouble ... think of it as a backstop.”

That said, what Barkin acknowledged the Fed is probably best known for is
monetary policy and its congressional mandate of stable prices and maximum
employment.

”We have a really, really big lever, which is interest rates. So we toggle the
interest rates up and down with the intent of trying to maintain stable prices
for this country,” he said. ”If we’ve learned anything in the last three years,
it’s how much we like stable prices, and how much we hate inflation. And so
that’s a really important mission.”

Barkin added it is always trying to maintain maximum employment, noting it would
be an easy task to get price growth down to zero, all that would be necessary
would be to take interest rates up to a million, but that would not be good for
employment.

When it came to its congressional mandate, the pandemic brought unique
challenges, he said.

”We had to answer the question — what can you best do to support the economy
through this perspective cliff that was in front of us?” he explained. ”We did
two or three things in March of 2020 that I think history will show were pretty
helpful. One was interest rates, which we took down to zero, so that creates
some economic support for the economy. A second is we put literally trillions of
dollars into the economy to try to support financial markets ... we basically
provided the liquidity that was needed in the market that had seized up to get
through.”

Barkin credited the stimulus packages for helping to do that, as well. He also
said the Fed was probably a bit slow to recognize it was dealing with inflation
when the economy started to open back up.

”When you get to the summer of 2021, what happened is the economy reopened.
Vaccines have been deployed and successful and those of us who were locked in
our homes decided it was time to buy Taylor Swift tickets, and the economy went
crazy,” he said. ”And, you know, 2020 hindsight, I’d say we were a little slow
to recognize that was anything other than temporary but it went crazy and supply
couldn’t keep up with it.”

To compensate, the Fed started raising interest rates, and Barkin said as a
result we saw a squeeze in areas such as the real estate market.

”When you raise interest rates, what happens is pretty straightforward.
Interest-sensitive sectors start to scale back, and so housing would be a good
example,” he explained. ”You will remember that two years ago, not only could
you not find a house, you couldn’t even elbow aside the other people who were
going in to visit the three houses that were on the market. The bids were coming
in and $20, $30, $40,000 over list and there would be competition for that. So
definitely some of the froth has been taken out of residential real estate. Same
with commercial banks.”

But he felt interest rates were now trending down.

”We’re definitely not done yet, but I will say that if I had been here a year
ago, and you’d said, how would you feel in a year if we had 2.6% headline
inflation, and that came at a cost of 3.7% unemployment, I would have taken
that,” he said.

Barkin said the pandemic had changed the landscape, noting that remote work was
having a profound effect on some communities. He also cited the shortage of
affordable housing and changes in the labor market — particularly a shortage of
skilled labor.

While he saw a difficult job market for professionals, for example, there are
more skilled labor opportunities than people to fill the jobs. Regarding
housing, he said some areas are building quickly because of available land, but
our region’s options were more limited, both geographically and by residents and
governments that were more averse to growth.

But when asked how he felt about the American economy overall, Barkin did not
hesitate in his answer.

”We are so much more healthy than the rest of the world, and it’s not even
close,” he said. ”There’s incredible vibrancy to this economy. We’ve benefited
from the fact that 80% of what we buy is produced domestically. Central Europe
has sclerosis ... China, having been a competitor for a long time, is clearly
struggling right now. You have a bunch of emerging market economies — India —
that are doing very well, but yet nowhere near as advanced as we are, and the
standard of living we live in is extraordinary.”

Noting the deficit, he said if he were asked, he would say the debts are not
sustainable. But it is all sustainable, he added, as long as the rest of the
world wants U.S. bonds. If they didn’t, that would be an issue, but he added,
”what other bonds would you invest in? Would you invest in Chinese bonds, or
French, U.K.? It’s actually hard to find what you’d invest in, that’s how much
stronger our economy is than the rest of the world.”

The final installment of the current ”Commonwealth Conversations” series is
slated for May 1 with the guest to be announced. Single tickets are $55 for
chamber members, $80 for nonmembers and include breakfast. Tables of eight
reserved seats with a company logo are $500 for chamber members and $700 for
nonmembers.

2024-03-01 16:30:31,CHINA PLEDGES TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOREIGN COMPANIES AS IT SEEKS TO BOOST ITS ECONOMY," BEIJING (AP) — Chinese Vice President Han Zheng pledged Friday to provide more opportunities for foreign companies in China as the government tries to restore confidence in the world’s second largest economy. 
Han told an audience of American business people in Beijing that the government would continue to open up more industries to foreign investment and create a market-oriented and law-based international business environment. 
“China’s development achievements have been made through opening up,” he said at an American Chamber of Commerce in China banquet. “We will unwaveringly adhere to a high level of opening-up to the outside world.” 
Chamber officials portrayed his appearance at the annual dinner as a positive signal that the government is serious about addressing the concerns of U.S. and other foreign companies about operating uncertainties and other challenges in the Chinese market. 
The U.S. and China remain divided on a wide range of issues from trade and technology to the war in Ukraine, but they are at least talking again and seeking ways to manage their differences. 
Both Premier Li Qiang and the commerce minister met this week with a visiting delegation led by Suzanne Clark, the head of the Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
“What I think the Chinese were trying to do is to reassure us that they know there are still things on the to-do list that need to get done and to reassure us that they will get done,” said the chair of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Sean Stein, who joined the meeting with Li. 
Progress has been made in some areas but not in others, Stein said before the dinner, adding, ”it’s been a mixed bag.” 
The American ambassador in China, Nicholas Burns, told the audience that several months of high-level meetings and exchanges had given a measure of badly needed stability to the U.S.-China relationship, but that difficult issues remain. 
He cited manufacturing overcapacity in China, which has raised fears in the U.S. and Europe that Chinese exports will flood their markets with exports; U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies that are supporting what he called “Russia’s defense-industrial complex,” and U.S. President Joe Biden’s recently stated concern that connected vehicles from China could pose a national security threat. 
Burns pushed back at Chinese accusations that the United States is seeking to decouple its economy from China’s, saying his country is only trying to reduce risk by diversifying its supply chains and restricting some exports because of national security concerns. 
“I must say frankly, too many here in China are suggesting that we are decoupling,” he said. ”But the facts will not support that argument. We are derisking, which is a necessary and fully justifiable policy.”"

In contrast, Serrano indicated that the dynamism in loans to companies comes
from national investment.

In fact, the chief economist of BBVA Mexico said that the effect of
‘nearshoring’ will be visible in new flows of foreign direct investment (FDI).

“If we understand nearshoring as the transfer of production from China to a
market near the United States, we need to increase foreign investment,” he said.

In this sense, he elaborated that, in terms of new investments, Mexico’s FDI at
the end of 2023 shows a decline.

2024-03-01 09:05:51,CEE ECONOMY-Central Europe’s PMIs show improvement but orders still lacking," By Jason Hovet 
PRAGUE, March 1 (Reuters) - Central European manufacturing activity showed some signs of improvement in February as a downturn in Poland and the Czech Republic eased while Hungary’s production increased, sector surveys showed on Friday. 
With industry remaining weak in central Europe, the region’s economies are looking for renewed consumer demand to propel growth this year after high inflation hit hard last year. 
Bright spots for the economy have started to appear as price growth slows. 
Updated gross domestic product (GDP) data from the Czech Republic on Friday showed the economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter - with a 0.2% quarter-on-quarter rise - after a third-quarter decline. Czech GDP fell by 0.4% last year, according to the statistics office release. 
Looking forward, S&P Global’s Czech manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 44.3 in February from 43.0 in January, hitting its highest since last March. However, it has been stuck below the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction since mid-2022. 
”Household consumption mainly helped the recovery of the economy (in the fourth quarter),” Banka Creditas economist Petr Dufek said, adding that negative signs in industry still remain. 
”There is a lack of orders and our main trading partner - Germany - is teetering on recession.” 
Central European manufacturers have struggled for orders with slack demand from euro zone partners, notably European economic powerhouse Germany. 
S&P Global’s Polish PMI rose to 47.9 in February, from 47.1 in January, as declines in both output and orders slowed. 
It follows statistics office data on Thursday showing the region’s biggest economy grew in year-on-year terms for a second straight quarter at the end of 2023. 
”The worst of the downturn appears to have passed,” Trevor Balchin, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a statement. ”The 12-month outlook for production improved further, reaching the highest since June 2021.” 
In Hungary, PMI rose to 52.2 in February from a revised 50.1 in January, with signs of moderate expansion appearing, the Association of Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory Management (MLBKT) said. 
The index of production volumes rose and was above 50 points. The volume of new orders also increased, but was only the 15th highest reading since 1995. 
”I think we should treat this PMI data carefully, it shows a relatively optimistic picture but we will see next week what the fresh industry output data show,” Peter Virovacz, an ING economist in Budapest, said.

2024-03-01 16:44:57,Fed monetary policy report warns on financial sector vulnerabilities," FILE PHOTO: An eagle tops the U.S. Federal Reserve building’s facade in Washington 
By Michael S. Derby and Dan Burns 
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said Friday in a report that there are ”notable” vulnerabilities on the financial stability front, although it added the stress banks were facing last spring has receded. 
The Fed report tied the vulnerabilities to borrowing levels, noting ”declines in the fair values of fixed-rate assets have been sizable relative to the regulatory capital at some banks.” 
But the Fed also said, ”acute stress in the banking system has receded since last spring, and banks’ regulatory risk-based capital ratios remained solid and increased broadly, as bank profits were robust and banks reduced capital distributions.” 
On the economy, the Fed reiterated it was committed to getting inflation pressures back to 2% and said the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee ”does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.” 
The twice-yearly report to Congress comes ahead of two days of testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell set for Wednesday and Thursday next week. The report is typically a recap of economic developments and actions taken by the Fed in the period since the previous update given to lawmakers, but can offer fresh takes on some of the latest economic data and on subjects such as financial stability. 
At the Fed’s most recent policy meeting in January, central bank staff briefed policymakers on their assessment of stability within the U.S. financial system, and according to minutes of the meeting released last week, they ”characterized the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable.” 
Powell is likely to face a barrage of lawmaker questions about the Fed’s tight policy stance and expectations for easing it, a sensitive topic in a presidential election year. 
A number of congressional Democrats have already been hounding Powell over high rates, complaining they are exacerbating already-poor housing affordability for low- and middle-income households. Republicans, meanwhile, have been critical about the Fed’s initially slow response to inflation and could chastise Powell over indications he may lower rates ahead of the November election. 
ELECTION-YEAR RATE CUTS 
The Fed’s next interest rate-setting meeting is scheduled for March 19-20, and policymakers are widely expected to leave their benchmark policy rate unchanged at 5.25%-5.5%, where it has been since July. 
After raising rates aggressively to that level starting in March 2022 to combat what evolved into the highest inflation in four decades, the Fed’s next move is expected to be a rate cut sometime in the coming months. That is because inflation has made substantial progress in moving back toward their target of 2% annually, though recent price data has been uneven. 
Updated projections from policymakers at that meeting should offer more clues for when officials may be ready to make their first cut in borrowing costs. Projections released at their December meeting showed a majority of officials then expected the policy rate to fall by three-quarters of a percentage point over the course of 2024, but that outlook offered no indication of when reductions might begin. 
After a benign run of inflation data through the second half of 2023 led financial markets initially to position for rate cuts as early as the March meeting, the first set of inflation readings for 2024 have at least temporarily stalled some of that momentum on taming the pace of price increases. 
Moreover, pushback from top Fed officials signaling no rush to cut rates while inflation progress remains bumpy and the labor market remains strong has led to a reset of market expectations. Market pricing now reflects a prevailing view that the first cut will occur in June, although a first cut at the April 30-May 1 meeting is not out of the question.

“Take some time to review your income and expenses to ensure you are staying on track with your financial goals,” said Smallwood. “Make clear, sound and realistic financial goals for the year. Break them down into smaller achievable steps. 
“For example, if there are any lingering debts generated from the holiday season, consider making it a goal to use Q1 bonuses and/or tax refunds to resolve them before the year reaches the halfway point. And remember, a financial professional can help.”

Forgotten subscriptions can really add up, sucking money from your budget that could be better used elsewhere. 
“Identify subscriptions or expenses that you can consolidate or eliminate to save money,” Smallwood recommended. “If you have a debit card or two that’s used for the majority of your subscriptions, consider canceling it and then re-sign up only for the subscriptions that are necessary. It’s also good to check your Apple or Android App subscriptions regularly to make sure there aren’t trials you signed up for that have become ongoing subscriptions without your knowledge.”

Being organized is a key part of managing your finances. 
“Gather important financial documents like bank statements, tax returns and insurance policies,” said Smallwood. “Put them in a safe place for easier access when needed. I would recommend having a physical copy of all documents to keep in an at-home safe or safe-deposit box at your local bank. It’s also good to have a secure and encrypted copy of all the same documents stored somewhere in the cloud. 
“For both the digital and analog documents, be sure to have at least one trusted confidant who has access to the documents. Securing your financial documents in one place will help come tax season. To get ahead of it, create a specific digital or physical folder at the start of each year to store tax-related receipts and documents.” 
Smallwood recommended looking at your investments to see if there are any adjustments that need to be made to keep you on track with your financial goals. 
“It’s always good to review investments around tax time, because there may be opportunities to save on taxes based on how your investments performed over the previous year,” he said. 
Here are Smallwood’s other suggestions for streamlining your investments: 
“Finally, there’s no substitute for a financial professional,” Smallwood said. “A solid one will work with you with each of these steps. Consult with someone who can work with you to build that pathway to financial prosperity. The right financial professional can act as a strategic breakthrough partner to help you achieve your wealth-building goals.” 
And if you’re not quite ready to work with a financial advisor, Smallwood said that there are online platforms, robo-advisors and financial apps that can help you with tasks such as analyzing performance and making informed decisions. 
“My recommendation is to find interest and desire to work with a financial professional,” he said. “While there are tools that are helpful, there’s no substitute for a partner who can work directly with you on your individual needs.”

Though there is no shortage of millionaires who got a significant amount of help from their family’s wealth, there’s also a fair amount of millionaires who build their fortunes all on their own.
Try This: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)
But self-made millionaires didn’t just magically slide into a massive net worth. They put in hard work to advance in their fields and make money that can all but guarantee a financially secure future — as long as they manage their fortunes wisely. One way these highly successful high earners get and stay rich is by staying informed and motivated. This means hitting the finance books.
But which finance books do self-made millionaires treasure the most? GOBankingRates consulted two self-made millionaires to get the scoop on their top fave reads — and what makes these literary works so impactful.

‘The Wealthy Barber’ by David Chilton
David Delisle , an author and self-made millionaire who began investing at the age of 11 and became semi-retired at age 40, pointed to a book that inspired him to build wealth as a kid called “The Wealthy Barber” by David Chilton.
“This is one of the first books I ever read about money, and I read it when I was 10,” Delisle said. “What I love about this book is how easy it was to read, even as a child. It’s written as a fun story with a local unassuming barber that has achieved financial freedom and then doles out a little wisdom during every haircut. This is when I first learned the power of compound growth, and that one lesson alone changed my relationship with money.”

‘The Psychology of Money’ by Morgan Housel
Looking to learn how money works on a mental and emotional level so as to remain clear headed about your financial path and goals? Consider “The Psychology of Money” by Morgan Housel.
Story continues
“This is an amazing book that tackles the psychology of money in a very simple and easily understandable way,” Delisle said. “What stands out to me is how he gives examples of how easy it is to fall into the trap of never having enough. This is very similar to the movement I’m hoping to inspire to break that same cycle of endlessly chasing more.”
‘The Richest Man in Babylon’ by George Samuel Clason
“This is a classic book that was written in 1926,” Delisle said. “What I love the most about this book is how the core principles of wealth haven’t changed over the past 100 years. All of the trends and fads come and go, but these core principles remain the same. For example, the term ‘pay yourself first’ is a core concept that I use and is a habit that is still the best way for most people to save.”
‘Think and Grow Rich’ by Napoleon Hill
Self-made millionaire Luke Lintz, CEO, entrepreneur and social media expert at HighKey Agency , said this book holds a special plate in his heart.
“This timeless masterpiece delves into the power of manifestation and intentionality in goal-setting, guiding readers through the process of reverse engineering their aspirations into tangible, achievable steps,” Lintz said. “Its profound teachings have guided my journey toward personal and financial growth, empowering me to envision my dreams and diligently work toward their realization.”
‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ by Robert T. Kiyosaki
If you’ve ever browsed or delved into personal finance or business literature, you’ve surely heard of this groundbreaking work.
“This book was introduced to me during my formative years in grade 9 [and] fundamentally reshaped my understanding of money,” Lintz said. “Contrasting the perspectives, mentalities and values of a rich dad versus a poor dad provided invaluable insights into the dynamics of wealth accumulation. Witnessing this stark comparison allowed me to reflect on my own upbringing and familial influences, leading to profound realizations about money management and financial mindset.”
‘From Blue to Digital Gold’ by Paul Alex Espinoza
“This book offers invaluable entrepreneurship and digital marketing lessons and delves into the mindset shifts necessary for achieving financial success,” Lintz said. “‘From Blue to Digital Gold’ provides a roadmap for building wealth and emphasizes the importance of resilience, adaptability and continuous learning. Paul’s insights into leveraging personal experiences and skills for entrepreneurial success resonate deeply and have played a pivotal role in shaping my own approach to wealth building.”

Unemployment Casts a Shadow Over California’s Economy
Tech layoffs, fallout from Hollywood strikes and an uptick in rural joblessness challenge a state with one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates.

Reporting from Los Angeles
March 1, 2024, 1:17 p.m. ET
For decades, California’s behemoth economy has outpaced those of most nations, holding an outsize role in shaping global trends in tech, entertainment and agriculture.
While that reputation remains, the state has a less enviable distinction: one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates.
Nationwide, the rate is 3.7 percent, and in January, the country added 353,000 jobs . California’s job growth has been slower than the nationwide average over the last year, and the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high — 5.1 percent in the latest data, a percentage point higher than a year earlier and outpaced only by Nevada’s 5.4 percent .
With layoffs in the tech-centered Bay Area, a slow rebound in Southern California from prolonged strikes in the entertainment industry and varying demand for agricultural workers, California is facing economic headwinds in the new year. And residents feel it.
The state has historically had higher unemployment than the U.S. average because of a work force that is younger and fast growing, said Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. Still, she noted, the labor force shrank in California in the past six months — a troubling trend.
“When looking at this shrinking, are there less opportunities and people have just stopped looking for work?” Ms. Bohn asked. “What will this mean for consumers and businesses?”

BEIJING (AP) — Chinese Vice President Han Zheng pledged Friday to provide more opportunities for foreign companies in China as the government tries to restore confidence in the world’s second largest economy. 
Han told an audience of American business people in Beijing that the government would continue to open up more industries to foreign investment and create a market-oriented and law-based international business environment. 
“China’s development achievements have been made through opening up,” he said at an American Chamber of Commerce in China banquet. “We will unwaveringly adhere to a high level of opening-up to the outside world.” 
Chamber officials portrayed his appearance at the annual dinner as a positive signal that the government is serious about addressing the concerns of U.S. and other foreign companies about operating uncertainties and other challenges in the Chinese market. 
The U.S. and China remain divided on a wide range of issues from trade and technology to the war in Ukraine, but they are at least talking again and seeking ways to manage their differences. 
Both Premier Li Qiang and the commerce minister met this week with a visiting delegation led by Suzanne Clark, the head of the Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
“What I think the Chinese were trying to do is to reassure us that they know there are still things on the to-do list that need to get done and to reassure us that they will get done,” said the chair of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Sean Stein, who joined the meeting with Li. 
Progress has been made in some areas but not in others, Stein said before the dinner, adding, “it’s been a mixed bag.” 
The American ambassador in China, Nicholas Burns, told the audience that several months of high-level meetings and exchanges had given a measure of badly needed stability to the U.S.-China relationship, but that difficult issues remain. 
He cited manufacturing overcapacity in China, which has raised fears in the U.S. and Europe that Chinese exports will flood their markets with exports; U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies that are supporting what he called “Russia’s defense-industrial complex,” and U.S. President Joe Biden’s recently stated concern that connected vehicles from China could pose a national security threat. 
Burns pushed back at Chinese accusations that the United States is seeking to decouple its economy from China’s, saying his country is only trying to reduce risk by diversifying its supply chains and restricting some exports because of national security concerns. 
“I must say frankly, too many here in China are suggesting that we are decoupling,” he said. “But the facts will not support that argument. We are derisking, which is a necessary and fully justifiable policy.”"

Elections for Orange County’s judges are among the least discussed in the county, with few details publicly available on who they are or what positions and opinions they bring to the bench. 
[Read: Santana: Finding The Real Judges of OC ]
Those questions extend to who funds their campaigns.
This election cycle, most judge candidates didn’t file financial disclosures with the OC Registrar of Voters because the courts are a state position and file to the California Secretary of State. 
But a Voice of OC review of financial disclosures filed by the five of the six candidates for judge in Orange County found most of the campaigns are largely funded by local police unions, the county sheriff deputies’ union, the county prosecutors’ union and defense attorneys who regularly argue cases before the court.
Altogether, Voice of OC found at least $423,000 that has been invested on deciding who the county’s next judges will be at the upcoming March 5 primary election – positions that hold six year terms. 
City Halls die in darkness. Local News keeps the lights on. Support Voice of OC Today.
Prosecutors Receive Most Funding for Judge Races
All three of Orange County’s elections for judge this year have one thing in common: The top fundraiser is currently a Deputy District Attorney. 
Nearly 75% of all the money spent on the judges’ races went to three candidates: Deputy prosecutors Jason Baez, Richard Zimmer and Whitney Bokosky. 
All three are also endorsed by county OC District Attorney Todd Spitzer, Sheriff Don Barnes and the unions for both the county sheriffs’ deputies and the assistant district attorneys. 
Bokosky, Baez and Zimmer did not respond to requests for comment. 
Zimmer received just over a third of all his campaign donations from law enforcement unions and individual donations from lawyers employed by the county, while nearly half of his donations came from individual defense attorneys or law firms. 
In total, he raised just over $50,000. 
He also loaned his campaign $37,000 out of his own pocket. 
His opponent, public defender Binh Dang, has disclosed no fundraising activity at either the county or state level. 
Both Baez and Bokosky also reported extensive fundraising from law enforcement unions and defense attorneys, which made up over 70% of both their campaign funds. 
In total, Baez raised around $96,000 and Bokosky brought in just under $60,000.  
The biggest donor across all three of their campaigns was the sheriff’s deputies union, which spent a combined $23,000 across all three of their races. 
They were followed by a slate of local police department’s unions, including the cities Orange, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Tustin and Westminster, who all spent between $1,000 to $1,500 supporting each candidate.  
Daniel Kern and Daniel Jacobson, who are running against Bokosky and Baez respectively, are largely self funded, with Kern loaning his campaign $8,000 while Jacobson invested $76,000 of his own money into his campaign.  
Wylie Aitken, chair of Voice of OC’s board of directors, endorsed Bokosky and Jacobson. 
How Do Judges Handle Their Campaign Donors? 
When judges have an attorney who donated to their campaign appear in their court, they are required to disclose any donation from $100 to $1,500 according to the California Code of Judicial Ethics . 
“The judge shall disclose any contribution or loan of $100 or more from a party, individual lawyer, or law office or firm in that matter as required by this canon,” states the legal code. “The judge has discretion to select the manner of disclosure, but the manner used shall avoid the appearance that the judge is soliciting campaign contributions.”
But if the donation exceeds $1,500, state law requires the judge be “disqualified,” from any case involving a donor, a point that’s repeated in the code of judicial ethics.

March 1 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve report released Friday flagged a range of what it deemed ”notable” vulnerabilities in financial markets, while adding the stress that roiled the banking sector a year ago has faded considerably.
The Fed also used the latest release of its periodic Monetary Policy Report to say that officials will not start moving their short-term interest rate target down until they gain greater confidence inflation is truly moving back to the 2% target.
In the report, the central bank noted a number of ways in which borrowing levels, or leverage, were increasing risks in the financial sector. It also said stock prices were ”close to historical highs.” The Fed said leverage at hedge funds had stabilized at high levels, while life insurers were facing a situation where they were becoming more reliant on non-traditional sources of funding.
Meanwhile, while banks’ sources of funding remain liquid and stable, funding costs were on the rise, the central bank said. But even with those rising challenges, the Fed report said ”the banking system remains sound and resilient” and ”acute stress in the banking system has receded since last spring.”
A year ago, the Fed contended with bank problems of a magnitude that forced it to launch a new liquidity facility, amid surging demand for central bank credit. Much of that borrowing has faded away as a major concern for markets and the central bank, and the Fed
will close this month
the Bank Term Funding Program stood up to deal with the troubles.
The Fed report said credit remains available for most who want it, while acknowledging borrowing’s high expense: ”Interest rates on both credit cards and auto loans remain higher than the levels observed in 2018 at the peak of the previous monetary policy tightening cycle.”
On the economy, the Fed reiterated it was committed to getting inflation pressures back to its target and said the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee ”does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.”
Fed forecasts from the close of last year, buttressed by officials’ comments, have all pointed to rate cuts this year amid falling inflation pressures. But economic strength and an uneven path back to 2% have pushed back market expectations of when the easing will start, likely toward the summer.
PRELUDE TO POWELL
The Fed’s twice-yearly report to Congress comes ahead of two days of testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell set for Wednesday and Thursday next week. Powell is likely to face a barrage of lawmaker questions about the Fed’s tight policy stance and expectations for easing it, a sensitive topic in a presidential election year.
The report generally recaps economic developments and actions taken by the Fed in the period since the previous update given to lawmakers. Fed concerns over financial markets’ vulnerabilities had already been noted in the release of meeting minutes for the January FOMC meeting, released last week.
At the Fed’s most recent policy meeting in January, central bank staff briefed policymakers on their assessment of stability within the U.S. financial system, with the minutes saying staff ”characterized the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable.”
A number of congressional Democrats have already been hounding Powell over high rates, complaining they are exacerbating already-poor housing affordability for low- and middle-income households. Republicans, meanwhile, have been critical about the Fed’s initially slow response to inflation and could chastise Powell over indications he may lower rates ahead of the November election.
ELECTION-YEAR RATE CUTS
The Fed’s next interest rate-setting meeting is scheduled for March 19-20, and policymakers are widely expected to leave their benchmark policy rate unchanged at 5.25%-5.5%, where it has been since July.
The upcoming meeting will also bring updated forecasts on inflation, employment, growth and interest rates. In December the Fed penciled in three rate cuts, and in comments to reporters on Wednesday, New York Fed leader John Williams said that outlook is a ”reasonable” place for Fed officials to think about the monetary policy outlook.
But the timing of action remains in question. After a benign run of inflation data through the second half of 2023 led financial markets initially to position for rate cuts as early as the March meeting, the first set of inflation readings for 2024 have at least temporarily stalled some of that momentum on taming the pace of price increases.
Market pricing now reflects a prevailing view that the first cut will occur in June, although a first cut at the April 30-May 1 meeting is not out of the question. (Reporting by Michael S. Derby, Ann Saphir, Lindsay Dunsmuir and Pete Schroeder; Editing by Nick Zieminski)
