2024-04-08 17:21:23,Norwegian Cruise Lines places its largest order for 8 new ships," Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH), the third-largest cruise operator, has ordered eight new ships for its three brands, the largest order in the company’s history. The ships are scheduled to be delivered over a 10-year period with four 200K ton ships with a capacity for 5K guests each to be delivered from 2030 to 2036. Oceania Cruises will take delivery of two 86K gross-ton ships with a capacity of 1,450 guests each in 2027 and 2029, while Regent Seven Seas will take delivery of two 77K gross-ton ships with a capacity of 850 guests each in 2026 and 2029. Norwegian (NCLH) currently operates a fleet of 32 ships with room for over 66K passengers. The ships will be made by Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri.  Along with the new ships, the company is also adding a new pier at its Great Stirrup Cay port at its private island in the Bahamas. The pier is expected to be complete by late 2025. “We expect these strategic investments will secure our growth trajectory, significantly boost our earnings profile, and enhance shareholder value well into the future. With a favorable payment structure that includes pre-delivery financing and modest initial installment payments, we still anticipate strong net leverage reduction of 1.5 turns by the end of 2024, relative to 2023,” CFO Mark Kempa said. Last month, Norwegian (NCLH) reported a 32% jump in FY23 revenue versus the pre-pandemic level, while revenue per passenger cruise day increased 17% from 2019. Additionally, advance ticket sales balance ended 2023 at a year-end record of $3.2B, up 56% from 2019.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as “forever chemicals” because of their longevity in the environment, are used in sportswear fabrics to make them water- and stain-resistant.  Although the Centers for Disease Control considers skin contact with PFAS a minor source of exposure, the U.S. and Europe are moving towards implementing a ban on PFAS in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The negative implications from a PFAS ban on apparel made by the Arc’teryx brand – which was sold to Amer Sports (AS) in 2005 – could lead to negative earnings and multiple revisions from the company, Hu said in her research note.

Markey (D-MA) and the Massachusetts delegation requested Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter to carefully review the planned deal, ""and oppose it if it would drive up health care costs or reduce patients’ quality of care in violation of antitrust law."" The deal would help indebted Steward to resolve its immediate financial issues and allow it to repay all outstanding obligations to Medical Properties Trust (MPW). ""This proposed merger, however, does not guarantee [Steward's hospitals] will stay open in the long-run, and in the meantime could lead to more expensive health care for vulnerable patients and create more opportunities for UnitedHealth to pad its profits with taxpayer dollars,"" the lawmakers wrote. The lawmakers laid out the anticompetitive impacts of the deal, noting that UnitedHealth (UNH) already has ""massive market power"" and this merger would further expand its consolidation of the market.

2024-04-08 16:04:32,"Nasdaq, S&P, and Dow, ended unchanged while yields moved up","Wall Street’s major market averages ended unchanged on Monday while Treasury yields continued their upward climb. Investors now shift their eyes to this week’s inflation print which is scheduled for Wednesday in the form of the CPI report. The tech focused Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) concluded +0.03%, the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) ended -0.04%, and the blue-chip Dow Jones (DJI) finished -0.03%. On a sector-by sector stance, five of the 11 S&P segments closed out Monday on top with the Real Estate and Consumer Discretionary sectors leading the way higher. In reverse, the two worst performing areas of the market were Energy and Health Care. Furthermore, U.S. Treasury yields were able to advance again. The shorter end U.S. 2 Year Treasury yield (US2Y) advanced by 4 basis points to 4.79%. At the same time the longer end U.S. 10 Year Treasury yield (US10Y) moved up by 2 basis points to 4.42%.

UBS now sees the precious metal topping $2,500 by year-end. The economic calendar was empty on Monday but Wall Street is set to receive the consumer price index for March on Wednesday and economists are predicting a 3.4% Y/Y rise. ""A hot inflation print for March can force the Fed to adopt a more hawkish monetary policy stance. With equity markets sitting at historically elevated levels, rate cuts getting taken off the calendar could spark a broad market pullback in the near-to-medium term,” Ahan Vashi, Investing Group leader of the Quantamental Investor stated. ""How fast the US economy is growing, and how fast inflation is falling, will determine how soon the Fed cuts rates, and that in turn will play a big role in determining rate/yield differentials,"" said Kit Juckes, F/X strategist at SocGen. ""A slip in core CPI inflation 3.7% y/y and a 0.3% monthly gain won’t really feed expectations of a June hike much after last week’s solid data dented them. Market expectations are drifting in favor of a cut in July rather than June and it’s easy to see why,"" Juckes added. ""Inflation concerns also meant that Treasury yields reached their highest levels since November across the curve,"" said Deutsche Bank's Henry Allen.

Next to best-in-class deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, Shell has a dominant position in LNG at ~17% of global supply, supported by a highly visible pipeline. Due to its dominance in production and storage capacity, Shell's LNG trading is in a highly advantaged position to exploit global price arbitrage, alone contributing ~$2.4B in Q4 net profit.
