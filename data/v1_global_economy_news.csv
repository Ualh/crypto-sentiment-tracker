Treasury yields were mixed Tuesday morning as traders looked ahead to this week’s U.S. inflation data.
What’s happening
The yield on the 2-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD02Y slid 4.3 basis points to 4.695%, from 4.738% on Monday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell 1.1 basis points to 4.287%, from 4.298% on Monday.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was little changed at 4.418% versus Monday’s 3 p.m. level.
What’s driving markets
Data released on Tuesday showed that U.S. durable-goods orders sank 6.1% in January, although the decline looks bigger than it ordinarily would be because of a short lull in orders for passenger planes from Boeing.
Separately, home prices in the 20 biggest U.S. metros rose for the 11th month in a row and hit a record high during a persistent shortage of availability for resale homes. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city house price index rose 0.2% in December compared with the previous month. And home prices in the 20 major U.S. metro markets were up 6.1% in the 12 months that ended in December.
Investors are awaiting further data this week that may help to shape the trajectory of Federal Reserve monetary policy. The first revision of U.S. GDP in the fourth quarter is due on Wednesday. And Thursday brings the personal consumption expenditure price index, the Fed’s favored inflation gauge.
For now, markets are pricing in a 97.5% probability that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at between 5.25% and 5.5% on March 20, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The chance of at least a 25-basis-point rate cut by June is seen at 62.9%.
Treasury will auction $42 billion of 7-year notes at 1 p.m. Eastern time.
What analysts are saying
“The Treasury market is faced with dueling narratives that won’t convincingly resolve in either direction anytime soon. As a result, we’re unlikely to see anything beyond choppy range-trading behavior further out the curve,” said BMO Capital Markets strategists Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman.
“The two primary camps in the U.S. rates market are 1.) January’s CPI [consumer-price index] was the anomaly and once the balance of Q1’s data is known, it will be clear that a Q2 rate cut is the most obvious outcome for the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] versus 2.) the market and Fed got too far ahead of themselves as was the case in 2023 and therefore rate cuts in 2024 are increasingly unlikely,” they wrote in a note on Tuesday.

Understanding the Visa Types
The U.S. offers various visa types, each serving different purposes of visit. For tourists, including babymooners, the B-2 visa is the most relevant. This non-immigrant visa is designed for those visiting the U.S. for leisure, medical treatment, or social events. Understanding the right Accepting visas type for your travel is crucial in applying correctly and avoiding unnecessary complications.
The Application Process: A Step-by-Step Guide
Determine Your Visa Type: As mentioned, the B-2 visa is ideal for babymoon trips. Begin by confirming this is the correct visa for your travel plans.
Complete the DS-160 Form: The Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application form, DS-160, is your first official step. Fill out this form meticulously, providing accurate and truthful information.
Schedule Your Interview: Visa applicants, especially from certain age groups, are required to attend an interview in the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in their country. Wait times for interview appointments can vary, so scheduling this as soon as your travel plans are confirmed is wise.
Prepare Your Documents: Gather necessary documents, including your passport, DS-160 confirmation page, interview appointment letter, photos, and financial and employment proofs. For expecting couples, additional documents regarding prenatal care and health insurance may be beneficial to demonstrate your preparedness for the trip.
Attend the Visa Interview: The interview is a critical part of the process. Be punctual, dress appropriately, and answer all questions honestly and clearly. For babymooners, be ready to discuss your travel plans, including how you intend to ensure a safe and comfortable trip for the expecting mother.
Tips for a Smooth Application
●   Apply Early: Embassies and consulates can have lengthy processing times, and delays are always possible. Applying well in advance of your planned travel date can alleviate stress and provide buffer time for any unforeseen issues.
●   Be Prepared: Thoroughly review your application and documents before your interview. Demonstrating preparedness and organisation can make a positive impression.
●   Consider Health and Safety: For babymooners, showing that you have considered health and safety can be crucial. Include information about medical facilities near your intended destination and any travel insurance that covers pregnancy-related matters.

Grand adepte de la guerre psychologique, Cédric Doumbé ne recule devant rien ou presque pour déstabiliser Baysangur Chamsoudinov avant leur combat au PFL Paris. De quoi évidemment faire réagir le clan de la pépite, le frère de « Baki » se montrant honnête sur la légende du Glory lors d’une récente interview.
Publicité
Plus les jours passent et plus la hype monte autour du combat tant attendu entre Cédric Doumbé et Baysangur Chamsoudinov. Il faut dire que les deux hommes sont en beef depuis des mois et le premier notamment use de toutes les cordes qu’il a à son arc pour perturber son jeune adversaire (22 ans), qui sera le clair outsider de leur choc :

On le sait depuis des années, « The Best » est un maître du trash-talking et fait en sorte d’entrer dans la tête de ses adversaires avant le combat. On a d’ailleurs vu que ça avait marché à merveille contre Jordan Zebo… et comme « Baki » n’avait pas hésité à le qualifier de surcoté avant que leur choc ne soit rendu officiel, le vétéran met les bouchées doubles afin de rappeler à tout le monde qui est le véritable patron.

Résultat, la pépite de l’ARES se retrouve constamment sous pression psychologique car Doumbé ne cesse de le tacler, de le provoquer voir de l’humilier publiquement. Ce ne serait évidemment pas étonnant qu’il en tire un énorme ressentiment vis-à-vis de la superstar, mais le frère de Baki assure que ce n’est pas le cas. Invité de la chaîne Youtube ImTarzan, Rassoul Chamsoudinov a ainsi tenu à mettre les choses au clair :
Publicité
On n’est pas du tout dans ce genre d’optique (détester Cédric Doumbé, ndlr). Ça reste un sport. On n’est pas là pour détester qui que ce soit ça reste un sportif qui travaille dur comme Baki aussi. Ça reste un frère peu importe ce qui se passe. Et je pense que vous allez tous voir qu’après le combat ils vont se serrer la main et ils vont limite se faire un câlin parce qu’en finalité c’est bien beau de parler sur les réseaux mais la réalité c’est que ça reste des gens corrects dans la vraie vie.
Après les réseaux c’est les réseaux, le trash-talking c’est le trash-talking et ce qu’il se passe dans la vraie vie, c’est différent. J’ai des retours de personnes qui sont autour de Doumbé et qui en disent que du bien. Pourquoi détester quelqu’un qu’on ne connaît pas vraiment ?
Publicité
On pourrait penser le contraire tant l’animosité entre les deux hommes sur les réseaux sociaux est palpable, mais le frère de Baysangur Chamsoudinov assure qu’il y a toujours du respect entre Cédric Doumbé et « Baki ». Ce qui ne devrait toutefois pas les empêcher de se rouer de coups à la moindre occasion, au PFL Paris."

Watching a feminist movie might not fix everything, but it will give you a boost. Get inspired by these powerful stories of even more powerful women, from Erin Brockovich and Norma Rae to the women of Hidden Figures and even a few ordinary women who remind us that all of our stories are important. 
Even a good coming-of-age story can help you connect with your inner girl and give you the strength to face the world as a woman. Over half of these films are directed by and/or written (sometimes, rarely co-written) by women too–though I will be the first to admit that sometimes men do trip (jk jk jk) and make a feminist film all by themselves. 
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) 
Okay, so ”We Are Not Things,” the rallying cry for a group of enslaved wives in this post-apocalyptic adventure film, is not the most nuanced feminist message. It’s pretty basic. But that’s fine, and doesn’t take away from how thrilling it is to see Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the other women flee a literal patriarchy and fight for their freedom.

But I’m A Cheerleader (1999) 
It’s wild that a satire about homophobia and conversion camps is so relevant 25 years later. And by ”wild,” I of course mean deeply depressing. We’ve come so far since the ’90s when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights and attitudes, but also not. At least Jamie Babbit’s film about a teenage girl whose friends and family realize she’s gay before she does and ship her off to ”become normal” is not depressing, despite the content! It’s silly, colorful, and deeply romantic.

Norma Rae (1979) 
This feminist classic is based on the true story of a woman who fights for healthy working conditions in the factory where she and her family are employed and ultimately starts a union for the workers. 
Design for Living (1933) 
Yes, a film older than sin can be feminist! This romantic comedy based on a Noel Coward play is, I kid you not, about a polyamorous relationship about two friends who fall for the same women and try to share. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t. But the woman is always in control, and that rules. 
Matilda (2022) 
Matilda is a tiny feminist hero, especially in Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel. If you and/or a little one in your vicinity need the reminder that ”sometimes you have to be a little bit naughty” to change the bad circumstances around you, I can’t recommend this movie enough. 
The Color Purple (1985) 
Celie, the protagonist of Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that this Steven Spielberg film is based on, does not have an easy life. She goes through a lot of pain and heartbreak and her journey gets very dark. But it’s bursting with feminist lessons and has such a satisfying ending. And if you like it, there was a recent movie adaptation of the Broadway musical The Color Purple starring Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson and Danielle Brooks that’s sooo good! 
Howard’s End (1992) 
Based on E.M. Forester’s novel, James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s film, follows two independent and progressive sisters at the turn of the 20th century who get romantically involved with a more conservative family. For every feminist period film about women who fight oppression, it’s nice to have stories like this about women who assert their right to be equal in everyday life! 
The Watermelon Woman (1996) 
Cheryl Dunye’s film centers on a woman (played by Dunye herself) who works in a video rental store and becomes obsessed with a Black woman in a 1930s film credited only as ”The Watermelon Woman.” 
Aliens (1986) 
James Cameron turned Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) from a scream queen/final girl into a feminist action star and icon in his sequel to Alien. And if you like this movie, I also recommend the recent feminist action horror science fiction movie Prey starring Amber Midthunder. 
Whale Rider (2002) 
Not only is Niki Caro’s film a lovely coming-of-age tale about a young Maori girl, but this girl in particular comes into her own as a leader throughout the film. Pai’s twin brother was chosen to be the leader of her tribe, but he died when he was a baby. Tradition states that only men can be chief, but Pai’s determined to change everyone’s minds. 
Barbie (2023) 
Oops, Greta Gerwig did it again! Inspired by the feminist text Reviving Ophelia, she took a doll meant to represent all women and turned it into a thoughtful (and hilarious) film for all women. The film not only got people to the movies this summer, but sparked a celebration of all things girlhood. 
Slums of Beverly Hills (1998) 
Natasha Lyonne stars in this coming-of-age story about a teenage girl raised by her divorced father and chaotic older cousin. It’s messy and frank about growing up as a teenage girl in a way that a lot of mainstream movies are afraid to be. 
Gone Girl (2014) 
For those who support women’s wrongs as well as women’s rights. For those who were forever changed by the ”Cool Girl” monologue. For those who have been so fed up with the world they want to do something drastic. May you live vicariously through this movie. It’s a feminist catharsis, not an endorsement! 
Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret. (2023) 
Kelly Freeman Craig directed the most incredible adaptation of the Judy Blume classic all about religion, coming-of-age, and strong women raising strong women. It should become a staple for old and young feminists everywhere. 
Desert Hearts (1985) 
Not only is this a lovely lesbian love story, it is a fascinating story about how difficult it was to obtain a quick divorce not too long ago. Vivian, the straight-laced English professor who the story is about, has to move across the country to establish a residence in Reno, Nevada in order to be free from the husband she no longer loves. It’s a painful reminder of the many ways women have been oppressed, even in modern society... though I promise this movie has a happy, beautiful, ending! 
The Invitation (2022) 
This hidden gem is a feminist take on gothic horror and vampire romance from director Jessica M. Thompson. Starring Nathalie Emmanuel from Game of Thrones, it’s spooky, silly, and ultimately triumphant. If you love it, I also recommend the gothic romance Crimson Peak from my favorite male feminist filmmaker Guillermo del Toro. 
Catherine, Called Birdy (2022) 
Your mileage may vary on Lena Dunham as a feminist auteur–she’s not for everyone and that’s fine–but IMHO, she knocked this one out of the park. This should be a sleepover movie? Is it a sleepover movie?? Bella Ramsey, who you know from The Last of Us as well as Game of Thrones, plays the titular role. Birdy’s not not interested in boys, but she’s not in any hurry to be married off. It’s a good commentary on societal pressures for women in history, and cute to boot! 
The Silence of the Lambs (1991) 
Everyone remembers Hannibal Lecter, but he’s actually neither the star nor the villain of this movie. The terrifying cannibal is really just a consultant! The true hero is Clarice Starling, an FBI agent who cracks the case and saves the kidnapped girl. Sometimes women save the day and don’t make a whole thing about it. 
Little Women (2019) 
Obviously, this movie made the list. Whether you want to watch the 2019 Greta Gerwig version with Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet or the 1994 Winona Ryder classic, both films tell the same story of four sisters living out their very different dreams and coming together to be there for each other when they need it most. 
Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019) 
Céline Sciamma made an achingly beautiful romance about a rich girl named Héloïse and the woman, Marianne, who is commissioned to paint her portrait on the occasion of her wedding. They’re so isolated in their little world that you hardly see men at all in the film, though the whims and societal demands of men make up for the majority of the film’s conflict. If you feel weird about watching Call Me By Your Name nowadays for reasons...watch this as an alternative. It has all of the young love vibes but none of the toxic men. 
10 Things I Hate About You (1999) 
They took one of Shakespeare’s most problematic plays, The Taming of the Shrew, and turned it into a sexy feminist romantic comedy. Come for Heath Ledger singing, stay for Julia Stiles’ heartbreaking poem at the end. 
Certain Women (2016) 
If you’re looking for a feminist movie that’s kind of chill and a little obscure, I recommend this collection of vignettes directed by Kelly Reichardt. It’s about ordinary women with different strengths, different desires, and different hardships. Sometimes feminism means that women don’t need to be exceptional to have their stories told. They can be ordinary and even relatable! 
What The Constitution Means To Me (2020) 
The streaming/filmed version of this Broadway play was directed by Marielle Heller, a director you should absolutely be keeping tabs on, and it is absolutely required watching. Heidi Schreck, the writer and star of the show, talks about her decades-long relationship with the United States Constitution and the generational trauma of women in America. Don’t worry, it’s not as Civics lesson-y as it sounds. You’ll learn a lot of things and feel a lot of feelings, but ”entertained” is one of them. 
Jennifer’s Body (2009) 
Have you heard? We all love Jennifer’s Body now. Your brother’s best friend might have told you it sucks... well he’s the one who sucks! Diablo Cody’s horror movie about a girl who exclusively murders fuckbois is kind of perfect. Send your apologies to Megan Fox ASAP. 
The Favourite (2018) 
Enough boring movies about kings and knights and dukes—booooo!!!! Gimme this lady-centric messy period piece, based on true events and real people. BTW, Queen Anne really was manipulated by her gal pal Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough, an intelligent woman with limited ways to make a difference in the world. Her whole life really did blow up when Abigail Masham came to court. Movies should be telling stories like this all the time. Women have always been there and we have always been interesting. 
The Farewell (2019) 
Lulu Wang made the perfect millennial coming-of-age movie with Awkwafina at the center. The movie isn’t feminist in an in-your-face way. It’s subtle. Awkwafina’s character doesn’t defy conventions or break any glass ceilings. It’s just an incredible film with a nuanced protagonist that will, particularly if you’re immersed in Western culture, will expand your perspective while also tugging the strings of familiarity. It’s a reminder that we should all be seeking out and watching more films made by woman directors as much as we can. 
Belle (2013) 
The true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle, a biracial heiress in 19th-century England, makes for a Jane Austen-esque tale (or Bridgerton if ya nasty) and a history lesson all in one. Also, if you’ve been enjoying the new Interview with the Vampire Series—and if you haven’t I don’t even want to know you—you might enjoy Sam Reid as a love interest in this. He’s a progressive lawyer and she’s so rich she doesn’t need to get married, so you don’t even need to throw out your feminism to thirst over him and root for romance. 
The Last Duel (2021) 
When this movie was announced, people learned it was about a real woman who accused her husband’s rival of rape, and instead of just believing her, the husband and the rapist duked it out in the titular duel, they were like no way! Sounds depressing! Who needs a movie about men not believing women? We know they don’t! Folks, I’m here to tell you that we were all wrong. This is, no joke, one of the most nuanced takes on sexual assault and how women move through the world that I have ever seen. It’s also very funny, in a cathartic way and a laugh-out-loud satirical way. 
Widows (2018) 
I love when predominantly male franchises are reimagined with female characters as much as the next gal. If we girls can relate to boy space orphans, superheroes, and wizards, they can relate to the girl ones! But can we get an original story?? Director Steve McQueen and writer Gillian Flynn, the power creative duo I never knew I needed, collaborated on this film about four women who team up to heist their way out of a debt left by their dead criminal husbands. Watching it feels like chugging an energy drink! (In a good way!) 
Erin Brockovich (2000) 
It’s Julia Roberts playing a badass single mother working as a legal assistant who single-handedly takes down a corrupt energy company that had been contaminating water in a California community and (almost) successfully covering it up. Oh, and it’s a true story. 
Hidden Figures (2016) 
Hidden Figures tells the story of the three Black female NASA employees who were the mathematicians behind John Glenn’s launch into space (and his safe return, obvs) in the 1960s. And did we mention the women are played by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe? You’re going to want to stream this. 
A League of Their Own (1992) 
Another obvious choice. An absolute classic from 1992, where women form their own baseball league after all the men are deployed in WWII. Not only is it a story of real women doing things people thought only men could do, but it also gave us this iconic line: “There’s no crying in baseball.” Which, honestly, is debatable. There’s crying in everything. When you’re done, watch the Amazon series adaptation that somehow manages to be twice as feminist and intersectional to boot! 
Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) 
Or Volume 2. You literally cannot go wrong here. Uma Thurman sets out to straight-up murder her ex (named Bill, in case you didn’t figure that one out), who tried to kill her first. Deadly revenge on an ex? Here. For. It. 
The Hunger Games (2012) 
Katniss is the female heroine that fantasy movies have been missing. (Give Elizabeth Swann her own film, for the love of gawd.) Watch as J. Law saves her sister’s life (and many others’) by volunteering to take her place in her country’s effed-up fight to the death. 
STREAM IT 
Wonder Woman (2017) 
I’m about to yeet on over to that exotic island made up solely of female warriors that Diana originates from. Even a washed-up Chris Pine couldn’t make me leave that paradise. However, a few years after Wonder Woman inspired a generation of female filmgoers, Birds of Prey brought feminism a little closer to home in Gotham. If you love Diana Prince, check out the Harley Quinn solo movie! 
Oceans 8 (2018) 
Gonna have to stan an all-female take on a classic film. Sandra Bullock leads her army of goddesses to carry out the heist of all heists. I, too, would risk prison for that $150 million necklace. Check out the all-lady Ghostbusters while you’re at it, too. 
Hustlers (2019) 
This movie is my own form of fanfic—except it’s based on a true story, which makes it all the more amazing. Four exotic dancers come together to take money from their sleazy Wall Street clients. Female solidarity, my friends. 
STREAM IT 
9 to 5 (1980) 
This 1980 classic stars Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton as working women who have some revenge fantasies (and then actual revenge) against their sexist, awful boss. In a pre-#MeToo era, this movie was, well, pretty much sending a message to the world that the #MeToo movement needed to happen. We got around to it... 40 years later. 
Legally Blonde (2001) 
With all the bending and snapping and overwhelming amount of pink and sparkles, it’s easy to forget sometimes just how feminist Legally Blonde is. It’s almost like femininity can be feminist and not something to be ashamed of! Even before all of her character growth and self-affirming realizations, Elle Woods just wakes up one morning and decides to go Harvard Law School, is told that’s a basically impossible goal, and then is like, ”Yeah, but I’m going to” and actually does. Goals. 
Frida (2002) 
Salma Hayek was very rightly nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance as legendary artist Frida Kahlo in this biopic. She lost to Nicole Kidman for her performance as Virginia Woolf in The Hours, another iconic performance as a famous female artist in a feminist film. What an embarrassment of riches! Frida Kahlo is a feminist icon, which makes her life story a must-see.

Chad Gable has been an incredible athlete who has impressed pro wrestling fans with his impressive technical skills. While Gable has mostly wrestled as a tag team specialist, his encounters with Gunther depicted his hunger for a singles championship win. On August 21st edition of RAW, Chad Gable ended Gunther’s undefeated streak by beating him for the Intercontinental Championship but there wasn’t a title change as it was a win via countout.
This has been more of a personal thing for Chad Gable than just winning the Intercontinental Championship. It is more about seeing the happy faces of his children than just winning the match. Gable’s daughter was seen crying during the September 4th edition of RAW when he lost to Gunther for the Intercontinental Championship. Since then, Gable has made it his first and foremost priority to win the Intercontinental Championship.
This has now been evident in an incredible promo that Gable has just released on his Twitter handle. The promo is fast-paced and motivational. It consists of Chad Gable being ardent, speaking about redemption, and training really hard for a shot at the Intercontinental Championship. At the end of the promo, he declares that he is winning the Intercontinental Championship.
Now that Brock Lesnar’s return to the company is in limbo due to his alleged involvement with Vince McMahon in sexual trafficking , the plans for Gunther vs. Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 40 are in the trash bin. Therefore, this makes it evident that the WWE will go for Chad Gable to finish his story.

It has been a long time for Chad Gable to get his shot at the big stage, and finally, it seems to be happening at the grandest stage of them all. The latest, Gunther defended his Intercontinental Championship was on the February 19th edition of RAW against Jey Uso. He hasn’t defended it at a PPV since defending it at the Survivor Series against Miz.
While there has been no official confirmation regarding Gunther’s next opponent, he will surely defend his Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania. It would be exciting to see how this storyline pays off, as it would be the story of a father desperately trying to prove to his children that he isn’t a “failure.”

2024-02-27 17:10:56,"Finally, yes to Sweden in NATO","But Hungary’s unseemly delay could lead to future problems On February 27 – finally, almost two years after Sweden’s NATO application – Hungary, as the last member country, approved Sweden’s membership in the Western defense alliance. 
For Sweden, it was truly a historic day, as it was for the four other Nordic countries, all of them now NATO members. 
With that, the military and security situation in northern Europe has radically changed. Russia is now facing a united NATO front along its western border, and the Baltic Sea is on all sides surrounded by NATO-members, with the narrow inlet to the Russian city of St Petersburg and the small Russian enclave of Kaliningrad as the only exceptions. 
That’s most likely not the outcome Vladimir Putin desired, or even foresaw, when he launched his war on Ukraine two years ago. That invasion, and that war, became the final straw for neutral Sweden and Finland to join NATO. 
“A historic day,” said Sweden’s prime minister Ulf Kristersson. The comment was repeated by many and not only in Sweden, which now has joined the Western defense alliance after 200 years of neutrality – a policy that saved the country from being drawn into World War II in contrast to all its Nordic neighbors. 
“We are more secure now as a member of NATO,” said opposition leader Magdalena Anderson, of the Social Democrats. Anderson, then as prime minister, started the membership application process shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – “a war,” she said on Tuesday, that “Russia must not win.” 
And NATO’s secretary general, Norwegian Jens Stoltenberg, proudly announced the successful end of the road for his Nordic neighbor, declaring that Sweden is now “safer” and NATO is now “stronger.” 
It was an unseemly delay by Hungary, which had stalled the Swedish application in conjunction with Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Erdogan. Only in late January this year did Turkey finally approve Sweden’s membership. 
Orban and Erdogan had already last year approved Finland’s application, but their approval of Sweden came well over a year after the 28 other NATO members had said yes to Swedish membership. 
The Erdogan/Orban delay action infuriated political leaders in Europe and in the US. What did the two get out of this? Well, Erdogan, finally, was allowed to purchase 40 US F-16 fighter jets while Orban’s yes paved the way for four additional Swedish Gripen fighter planes for Hungary’s air force. 
But their delay tactic will not produce good will. Here were two leaders of, mildly put, troubled democracies, finding faults with two of Europe’s leading examples of democratic openness and debate. It did not sit well with many. 
For Orban, in particular, whose country is also a member of the European Union, his delaying action could lead to future friction and problems. His authoritarian tendencies were already seen as deeply worrisome, and his coziness with Vladimir Putin as the Russian leader’s closest ally in Europe was regarded with deep skepticism and uneasiness. 
I met Viktor Orban many years ago, in March of 1990, at a huge election rally with the Young Democrats (FIDESZ) at the Nemzeti sports arena in Budapest, in the run-up to Hungary’s first free and democratic elections in the post-Communist era in Eastern Europe. 
Those were exciting and enthusiastic days and Orban, then a 27-year-old law student active in the student dissident movement, symbolized much of that excitement and enthusiasm. “The existence of FIDESZ is a particular Hungarian phenomenon,” said Orban. “We are not linked to the Communist past. We are clean. And we are regarded as honest.” 
But in the highly fragmented parliamentary elections that spring, FIDESZ received only 5.4 percent of the vote and 21 seats in the new legislature, barely reaching the four percent threshold. 
Today, FIDESZ is still led by Orban, prime minister since 2010 with a huge parliamentary majority but – having moved to the right in a shift to what he has called an “illiberal democracy – an undisputed, authoritarian leader of a nation where many see serious democratic backsliding taking place. 
Today, Viktor Orban is also the Europe’s leading Trumpist, having declared in his recent State of the Nation speech: 
We cannot interfere in other countries’ elections, but we would very much like to see President Donald Trump return to the White House and make peace here in the eastern half of Europe. It is time for another “Make America Great Again” presidency in the United States. We ourselves are preparing for a presidency. I am talking about the Hungarian EU Presidency. Make Europe Great Again! Over there MAGA, over here MEGA. 
This summer, Orban’s Hungary will assume the rotating EU presidency for six months. What will that mean, for Europe, and for Ukraine? All I can say is, Europe: beware!

2024-02-24 00:50:28,The Wendy Williams documentary will continue to air this weekend after the guardian filed a lawsuit against Lifetime’s parent company," — 
Wendy Williams’ court-appointed guardian failed in his attempt to stop a revealing documentary about the former talk show host from airing on Lifetime this weekend, according to a source familiar with the legal proceedings. 
“Lifetime appeared in court today and the documentary ‘Where Is Wendy Williams?’ will air this weekend as planned,” a spokesperson for the network told CNN on Friday. 
Williams’ legal guardian filed a lawsuit against Lifetime’s parent company A&E Television Networks in a New York state court on Thursday, the source told CNN. The lawsuit is under seal, so the contents of the lawsuit are not public knowledge, but the person said Williams’ legal guardian has asked the court for an injunction to stop Lifetime from airing the documentary. 
Lifetime declined to comment on the substance of the lawsuit. 
The four-part documentary “Where’s Wendy Williams?” offers a painfully candid account of Williams’ life as she struggles with health problems and alcohol abuse. The executive producer is Williams herself and her family is present on camera. 
Williams was diagnosed with aphasia and dementia in 2023, according to a statement from her care team on Thursday. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, the disorders can affect cognitive function, communication and language in affected individuals. 
According to Lifetime, the guardianship approved Williams’ involvement in the project. 
The motion to seal the contents of the lawsuit, obtained by CNN, names Sabrina Morrissey, an attorney specializing in guardianships, as WWH’s “temporary guardian” (Williams’ full name is Wendy Williams Hunter). 
Morrissey has not responded to multiple requests for comment from CNN. An attorney for Morrissey did not immediately respond for comment. 
Although her care team did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment about the documentary or the lawsuit filed by Williams’ guardian, a representative from the care team issued a statement on Williams’ behalf Friday afternoon. 
“I would like to say that I am very grateful for the love and kind words I received after sharing my diagnosis of aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Let me say, wow! “Their response was overwhelming,” the statement read in part. “I still need personal space and peace to thrive. Please know that your positivity and encouragement are greatly appreciated.” 
When Williams originally pitched the documentary for Lifetime, the idea was to capture her life after her talk show while she worked to launch a podcast. But as cameras began rolling, producers realized that the story they originally wanted to tell would be very different. 
Mark Ford, executive producer of the documentary project, told CNN that nothing was filmed without the consent of Williams or her manager. 
“We understand that some of their fans may find it difficult to watch. “But we believe this documentary captures the truth of Wendy’s life in the year and a half we filmed it,” Ford added. 
At the end of filming, Ford says producers became so concerned about Williams’ health that they urged her management team to seek new medical care. “The documentary evolved into a direct portrayal of Wendy’s dire health and whether or not she received appropriate care,” he said. 
According to her family and a Lifetime representative, Williams is currently in an inpatient cognitive care treatment facility. The project’s producers have not been in direct contact with Williams for more than six months. 
Williams’ niece Alex Finnie, who stars in the Lifetime documentary, told CNN this week that she didn’t know if her aunt had seen the finished project. She said Williams told her she wanted to make the documentary so she could reclaim her own narrative, no matter how painful the subject might be. 
“We talked about it briefly,” Finnie told CNN. “It’s a really sensitive topic.”

Wendy Williams speaks on stage at the 2014 Soul Train Music Awards. 
Williams’ family expressed concerns about the conservatorship but said they are glad she is now receiving proper care. Finnie told CNN that she communicates regularly with her aunt and had spoken to her days ago. However, because Williams is currently under the court-ordered agreement, she said her family does not know the location or other information about the facility where Williams is being treated, nor does she have the ability to call Williams directly. 
Williams was placed under court-ordered financial conservatorship in February 2022 after Wells Fargo froze Williams’ accounts when a former financial advisor to the bank’s host reported that Williams was “mentally disturbed,” according to court documents referenced in the Lifetime documentary is referred. 
Finnie said her family hopes the documentary will shed light not only on Williams’ journey, but also on the larger issue of guardianships and conservatorships. 
“I really hope that people see my aunt as a human being, empathize with her, pray for her and hope that she is better than ever, but also with an understanding of the entire system that really controls her life not just for now them, but for so many other people who are also at the center,” Finnie said. 
The documentary’s producers believe the project and her collaboration with Williams led to her receiving better support. 
“On a personal level, we all care deeply about Wendy. We’re glad she’s doing better now,” Ford told CNN. “And we hope that the documentary helped get her to that safer place.”"
2024-02-23 19:50:21,“Reds sign Mike Ford to minor league deal.”," The Reds have agreed to a minor league deal with the first baseman/designated hitter Mike Ford, Reports Jon Heyman of the New York Post. The ZS Sports client would earn $1.3 million in the major leagues and can secure $125,000 worth of additional incentives from the deal, which includes opt-out dates during both spring training and the regular season. 
The 31-year-old Ford posted huge power numbers in 2023 with the Mariners, slashing .228/.323/.475 with 16 home runs in just 251 trips to the plate. This performance was accompanied by an above-average walk rate of 9.6%, but also a bloated strikeout rate of 32.3%. The former Yankees farmhand has a long history of strong power and questionable contact rates, so the 2023 season wasn’t unusual in that regard. However, last season was also Ford’s longest and most productive stretch in the major leagues. He had never before even reached 200 plate appearances in a major league season. 
Ford, who plays left-handed, hasn’t faced lefties much in his career, but he torched them in 24 plate appearances last year and has actually fared better against lefties throughout his career. It’s only 108 plate appearances, but he’s a .268/.343/.577 hitter against lefties compared to .200/.303/.389 against righties (in a much larger sample of 611 plate appearances). 
Cincinnati already has more infielders than infield bats – so much so Spencer Steer will be moved to left field on a full-time basis in 2024. Yet the Reds did so Jeimer Candelario, Jonathan India, Noelvi Marte, Elly Dela Cruz, Matt McLain And Christian Encarnacion Beach in a line to rotate around the infield and the entire DH spot. Ford gives Cincinnati a left-handed depth option that can take over first or DH work in the event of injury or regression to one of its promising young infielders. As it stands, Candelario, Encarnacion-Strand and India are likely to see the most action at first base and downhill, but a strong spring could push Ford into the mix – or, considering spring exit dates, the deal could, at least serve as an audition for another club looking for left-handers.

2024-02-23 22:00:37,Google explains Gemini’s “embarrassing” AI images of various Nazis," Google has issued an explanation for the “embarrassing and inaccurate” images generated by its AI tool Gemini. In a blog post Friday, Google said its model produced “inaccurate historical” images due to optimization issues. The edge and others caught Gemini earlier this week creating images of racially diverse Nazis and US founding fathers. 
“Our vote to ensure Gemini shows a range of people did not take into account the cases that should be clear not Show reach,” Google senior vice president Prabhakar Raghavan wrote in the post. “And second, over time, the model became much more cautious than we intended, refusing to fully respond to certain prompts – and misinterpreting some very innocuous prompts as sensitive.” 
Gemini’s results for the prompt “create an image of a 19th century U.S. senator.”Screenshot by Adi Robertson 
Gemini’s results for the prompt “create an image of a 19th century U.S. senator.” 
This caused Gemini AI to “overcompensate in some cases,” as we saw with the images of the racially diverse Nazis. It also caused Gemini to become “over-conservative.” This resulted in it refusing to create specific images of a “black person” or a “white person” when asked to do so. 
In the blog post, Raghavan says that Google is “sorry that the feature didn’t work well.” He also points out that Google wants Gemini to “work well for everyone,” and that means displaying images of different types of people (including different ethnicities) when searching for images of “football players” or “someone who.” “walking a dog” asks. But he says: 
However, if you’re asking Gemini for images of a specific type of person—say, “a black teacher in a classroom” or “a white veterinarian with a dog”—or people in a particular cultural or historical context, be sure to get one Answer that reflects exactly what you are asking for. 
Raghavan says Google will continue to test Gemini AI’s image generation capabilities and “work to significantly improve them” before enabling them again. “As we have said from the beginning, hallucinations are a well-known challenge in all LLMs [large language models] – There are cases where the AI simply does something wrong,” notes Raghavan. “This is something we are constantly working to improve.”"

Grapefruit League play for the Phillies begins Saturday and Rob Thomson lays out the pitching plans for the first four games.
As he previously said, left-hander Kolby Allard will start against the Blue Jays in Dunedin on Saturday and Aaron Nola will start in the spring home opener against the Yankees on Sunday. Each is expected to pitch two innings.
David Buchanan will start on Monday and Cristopher Sanchez on Tuesday. The games are against the Red Sox and Twins in Fort Myers, 140 miles from Clearwater.
For a season as good as 2023, Sanchez barely had spring training. He pitched only three innings because of triceps pain and then slowly improved. He comes into this camp in a completely different place – healthy, confident and knowing his rotation point is solidified.
Injury updates
• Alec Bohm won’t play in at least one of the Fort Myers games until now. He struggles with neck spasms.
• Third-string catcher Rafael Marchan is dealing with a lower back injury. “It’s just a precautionary measure. Turn it off and see if we can quiet the problem,” Thomson told reporters.
• Brandon Marsh, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Feb. 9, ran without a knee brace on Friday.
“They told him to get 60 percent,” Thomson said. “I said, if that’s 60 percent, you’re a world-class runner.”
The team set a three- to four-week timeline for Marsh’s return the day of surgery and expects him to be ready for Opening Day on March 28 in Philly."
2024-02-27 17:29:04,"The extremely rare Zelda game could fetch more than $700,000 at auction","Pinterest
As Physical video games are becoming increasingly difficult to find because of Endless digitalization, people love collecting tangible items, especially when they are rare and sealed items. A 22-year-old Californian named Kiro recently came across such a rarity: a sealed copy from 1987 The Legend of Zelda, and almost had it auctioned off for a paltry $17,000 before it was officially appraised. And if you know how these things work, then you know the seller can bake some serious bread.
Game week: Pokémon with weapons and other new releases
Accordingly on February 22nd CNBC reportCollector-dealer Kiro said the vintage game has been in the family since it was sold at the now-defunct Fedco department store in 1987 for $29.87 $82.92 in 2024, adjusted for inflation). A regular eBay seller of collectible Barbies and sneakers, Kiro thought he’d put the sealed NES game on the online marketplace to see if he could make some money. So he released it in October 2023 for $17,000, thinking that was all he would get and he would be done with it. It was sold, but like he said CNBCWithin minutes, more offers came in.
“I was like, ‘Yo, this is wild. “There’s no way I sold it that quickly,” Kiro told the publication. “Several people immediately messaged me on eBay. One offered to drive me over and give me $30,000 in cash.”
Knowing that people were digitally eavesdropping on each other to learn the game, Kiro canceled the sale and withdrew the offer. He knew he had something special on his hands, but he didn’t know how special the sealed NES game was. Until he received a message from a collector telling Kiro over the phone that his copy of The Legend of Zelda came from the very first production run of the game and is therefore rarer than rare. Within two weeks, Kiro traveled from Florida to have the game professionally appraised to Texas to meet with the multinational auction house Heritage Auctions and complete the sale. It actually is just on the side and how CNBC In short, Heritage Auctions’ Video Games Signature Auction will be headlining February 23-24.
The last time an AND Zelda One such game was auctioned was in July 2021. At that time, a sealed copy of the game sold for $870,000. The valuation was slightly higher on this item than Kiro, but either way the 22-year-old’s extremely rare game will likely fetch a similar price. Only time can tell. If he does that, he surely has a plan for the money he will make, no matter how much it may end up being.
“I sat down with one [certified public accountant]said Kiro. “I definitely won’t spend it right away. It will serve to build long-term wealth for me and my family.”"
2024-02-27 17:29:04,Let The Walking Dead die,"Pinterest
A decade ago, The walking dead wasn’t just a TV show, it was an inescapable cultural phenomenon. Manufactured early on with precision, powerful performance and prosthetics TWD surpassed the regular zombie category when it premiered in 2010 – this pilot is still flawless today. In its early seasons, the AMC series broke its genre and presented a compelling post-apocalyptic survival story by delving into frighteningly real human emotions. It also managed to bring the comic storylines and character dynamics to life with distinct twists. Unfortunately, the show lost sight of these things over time.
Please, game developers, stop with The Killmonger Swoop now
Essentially similar to the “Wanderers”, TWD eventually became an unrecognizable, messy, empty shell. It lasted mercilessly until 2022 when it came to an end after eleven seasons. That was far from the end. The franchise continued with spin-offs produced by Understandable (Fear the walking death) to raise the eyebrows (The beyond of the world) to drastic (Stories from The Walking Dead). And it got worse. There were the egregious mistakes of others Spin-offs for Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), Maggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan) and Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). A so-called series finale is pointless if the audience has no time for the beloved original characters. (Give us a chance to miss you, TWD!)
The transparent, pointless gimmick is expanded even further with the latest six-parter in the series: The ones who live (TOWL), premiering February 25th. The show is a desperate last attempt to breathe new life into a universe surviving on a ventilator. It’s extreme nostalgia bait because it focuses on Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), aka the man who started it all. TOWL Rick catches up afterwards He left early in a helicopter TWD Season nine (in 2018, for those keeping track). His wife Michonne (a sensational Danai Gurira) broke away from the group in Season 10 to hunt him down after finding out he was alive.

The Walking Dead: Those Who Live
An electric Rick and Michonne, or “Richonne” as Stans calls himReunification is a lofty goal. But it’s not nearly enough to save whatever TWD want to be in today’s landscape. The same storyline would have – and could have – had a big impact years ago, back in the day TOWL was intended as three films to complete Rick’s arc (side note: announcing this plan after Lincoln’s departure ignored the emotional value of his departure). Production delays caused by the pandemic led to a limited series instead. But after all this time, the new series (four out of six episodes were watched for this review) is a cry for help to stay relevant.
Don’t get us wrong, Lincoln and Gurira are still surprisingly heartbreaking to watch. They are superb actors with an undeniable feel for their characters, and together they are exhilarating to watch. But is that enough? No. It’s also frustrating that the uncompromising reconciliation between Rick and Michonne doesn’t happen until near the end of the series. TOWL inevitably devotes itself to fleshing out the final years of Rick’s life in the Civic Republic military. The organization appeared sporadically in TWDThere are various offers, but for now there is a boring look into his evil machinations.
Here, Rick is terrified and resigned to his fate after several failed attempts to return to his family. His Tether is a dreamy vision of his wife in a non-apocalyptic world. Meanwhile, Michonne goes through a difficult adventure trying to reach her husband, losing friends along the way and eventually meeting a Rick she doesn’t quite know. He rises through the CRM ranks; She desperately wants to bring him back to her children. Will they clash or team up? Beneath the layers of exposition and forced plot twists lies a kernel of potential for the “Epic love story,” Lincoln and Gurira teased at a recent TCA panel.
Those who live | First trailer | Premieres February 25th AMC & AMC+
A comprehensive fourth episode delves into the details of Rick and Michonne’s relationship. Filmed like an indie, it contains hints of the film that could have been. (Thanks to Gurira for writing the episode). That’s the series’ unique strength, but the build-up is tedious and nothing TWD has never done it. If spin-off number six (!) uses the same tricks, why bother? The ones who live rushes carelessly through deaths, months, and events, making it hard to care. The show features supporting characters played by people like Lost’s Terry O’Quinn and LuciferIt’s Lesley Ann Brandt. Don’t bother investing in their outcome, because the show doesn’t I take care of her too. O’Quinn in particular is immersed in a convoluted, largely villainous role.
TOWL doesn’t add anything imaginative to it TWD Lineup and she fails to reinvent the wheel. The only lesson to be learned from this is that profitable As hard as it may be, sometimes letting go is the right answer. Not everything good lasts forever. Look, this author shamelessly drank alcohol The walking dead for a long time because it was incredibly compelling. It’s hard to say when the downfall began – Glenn’s (Steven Yeun) skull crushing, Negan’s arrival or Rick’s departure? Maybe that’s when zombies became an afterthought, let alone a credible threat. In TOWLStrollers don’t add to the thrill either. So TWD While the film garnered huge viewership and a large fan base in the early 2010s, it has long since surpassed its popularity.
This infinite Abyss is worth asking given AMC’s other refreshing but overlooked originals (The terror, Stop and catch fire, Dark winds, Kevin can fuck himself, This will hurtAnd Interview with the vampire come to mind). How did the cable network — and us as an audience — conspire to keep it? The walking dead still alive in 2024? Now every ounce of creativity has been squeezed out of it. Despite Lincoln and Gurira’s sincere efforts and hot chemistry, The ones who live must be the last straw that breaks the camel’s back. Please, let’s say it The walking dead now out of his misery.

When it was time to leave, McKay swapped out his existing profile picture for one that resembled an angrier version of Slackbot’s actual icon.

Fortum said Tuesday it has initiated arbitration proceedings against the Russian Federation and will claim compensation for the unlawful seizure of its assets in order to protect its legal position and shareholder interests. The commencement of arbitration proceedings follows the Russian Federation’s violations of its investment treaty obligations under the Bilateral Investment Treaties that Russia has with the Netherlands and Sweden.
In July 2023, Fortum sent notices of dispute to the Russian Federation, which were the first steps required for the arbitration proceedings. The Russian Federation however failed to engage in any settlement discussions with Fortum. Fortum said it will seek compensation for the value of its shares in PAO Fortum and its investments in Russia, amounting to several billions of euros.
According to Fortum, the dispute stems from the hostile actions taken by the Russian Federation which culminated with the Presidential Decree No. 302 issued on 25 April 2023, whereby the Russian authorities seized control of Fortum’s assets in Russia and deprived Fortum of its shareholder rights.  
The expropriation of the Russian assets triggered a full financial deconsolidation and impairment of those assets, as reported in Fortum’s second quarter 2023 results. Subsequently, the Russian assets were fully separated from Fortum, and the new management put in place by the Russian Government renamed PAO Fortum as Forward Energo. 
Fortum said it will continue to take all necessary steps to protect its investments and rights."

n the vast expanse of Balochistan, where the mountains touch the sky and the desert stretches as far as the eye can see, lies a challenge that defines the dreams of its people: education. My own journey through Balochistan’s education system paints a picture of struggle and hope, reflecting the experiences of many others like me.
During my time in middle school, I faced a tough situation. Despite doing well in my studies, the teachers struggled to teach us properly. They tried their best, but with low pay and not enough resources, it was hard for them to give us the education we deserved. Even private schools, which people thought would be better, weren’t much help. They cared more about making money than about giving us a good education. Furthermore, even in private schools, I witnessed owners sending their children to elite institutions rather than admitting them to their own schools. This glaring disparity suggests that the owners themselves recognize the inadequacies of the schools they oversee, thus raising serious concerns about the quality of education being provided.
Moving on to high school, things didn’t get much better. Cheating was everywhere, making it hard to focus on learning. It felt like our education was slipping away from us. Furthermore, the higher education system in Balochistan is outdated. The syllabus includes subjects that are no longer relevant in today’s world. Additionally, many teachers are unqualified and lack the necessary skills to effectively teach. They are often hired based on their ability to memorize multiple-choice questions and content solely for exam clearance, rather than their ability to deliver quality lectures. With teachers of this caliber, it’s challenging to produce students who can compete on international standards. Moreover, the research culture in Balochistan is lacking, with many researchers resorting to plagiarism instead of conducting original studies. This culture of academic dishonesty further undermines the quality of education in the region.
But even in the midst of all these challenges, there’s still hope. The question of how and when Balochistan’s education system will improve is a big one, and it needs answers. First, we need to admit that there are problems holding us back. We need to support our teachers better by giving them more training and resources. We also need to make sure that everyone follows the rules and values learning. But fixing education in Balochistan isn’t just up to the teachers. It’s up to everyone  the government, the community leaders, and even the students themselves. We all need to work together to make things better.
So who holds the key to change? The answer is simple: all of us. From government officials to community leaders to parents and students, each of us plays a role in shaping the future of education in Balochistan. But where do we start? The first step is acknowledging the problems that exist. We can’t hope to fix something if we don’t understand what’s broken. From there, we need to come together to develop concrete plans for improvement.
One area that is in desperate need of attention is teacher training and support. Teachers are the backbone of any education system, and yet in Balochistan, they are often undervalued and undertrained. By investing in ongoing professional development and providing teachers with the resources they need to succeed, we can ensure that every child receives a quality education. Equally important is the need to address the culture of cheating that pervades many schools in Balochistan. Cheating not only undermines the value of education but also perpetuates a cycle of dishonesty that is difficult to break. By promoting honesty and integrity in our schools, we can create an environment where students are encouraged to learn and grow. Of course, none of this will be easy. It will require dedication, determination, and a willingness to confront the entrenched interests that benefit from the status quo. But if we truly believe in the power of education to transform lives, then we must be willing to fight for it.
In conclusion, the time for change is now. Let us come together as a community to demand better for our children and future generations. By working together, we can unlock the potential of Balochistan’s education system and ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed. The future is in our hands – let’s make it a bright one."

CharlieIntel first reported on Twitter that skill-based match making, the algorithm for balancing matches in online games, was also affected. According to players, Modern Warfare 3’s matchmaking rules were drastically relaxed and matches seemed easier to manage while the issues persisted. While it is still possible (at least as of this writing) to access multiplayer to try out Modern Warfare 3 without SBMM active, players will likely experience unusual behavior with their player ranks and weapon progression when playing during this time. 
Sledgehammer Games, the lead studio behind Modern Warfare 3, recently explained to players how SBMM works for the hugely popular first-person shooter. The developers had even shared plans to create an experimental playlist to allow players to participate in games without SBMM, although no date for the experiment was publicly announced. 
The outage comes shortly after Call of Duty was declared the best-selling game of January 2024. Activision’s hugely popular first-person shooter franchise is under the wing of Xbox after Microsoft bought the publisher for a record-breaking $70 billion, officially closing last October. In January, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees, including many from Activision and Activision-owned studios, who were responsible for the development and ongoing maintenance of Call of Duty. 
Xbox also faced challenges adding Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass, due in part to the deal’s lengthy legal challenges, which limited collaboration between the companies involved in the merger until the deal was finalized.

2024-02-27 17:29:04,Will “Hey Google” ever become “Hey Gemini”?,"Pinterest
My reservations about Google calling all of its AI features “Gemini” remain, but most users seem to like the rebranding. One thing I’ve seen speculation about is a “Hey Gemini” hotword in the future.
9to5Google has one newly launched newsletter Here, the biggest Google stories are highlighted with additional commentary and other tidbits. Sign up to get it early in your inbox or read 9to5Google Log Out below:
“Hey Google” – and before that “Ok Google” – was a strategic branding choice for the company. It was never called “Hey Assistant” because we want people’s primary relationship to be with Google, not a specific product. This strategy has allusions to the fact that “Google” is the de facto verb for searching the Internet and is ingrained in the modern lexicon. Hey Google was an attempt to continue that legacy and ubiquity of voice search.
This earlier approach is why I was so surprised that Google decided to boost “Gemini” so much. (The other reason is that I think Google is pigeonholing itself if the modeling approach/naming ever changes.) Historically, Google names its products after the main feature, such as Search, Gmail, Drive, Documents, Calendar, Tasks, Chat, Home, TV, Messages, Messages, Photos, Translate and Wallet.
The major exceptions – Chrome, Android and YouTube – to this naming scheme are rare, with the latter two being acquisitions.
Gemini does not naturally convey a product or an action. (This could happen if more people knew that it is the Latin word for Gemini and that Gemini has agent-like abilities.) This means that Google has to do a lot of advertising and awareness, with Gemini being very lucky if it does Level of the two of Google approaches computer platforms and the video site.
If Google commits to this branding and effort, I think it at least increases the chance that “Gemini” could become a buzzword in the future. As a hotword, “Gemini” has three syllables compared to Google’s two, but is short enough.
It would be a very big bet to assume that “Gemini” would become synonymous with “Google.” Personally, I prefer the original strategy of focusing everything on Google’s main brand rather than developing a secondary brand, which I think is fine, but isn’t great as a name.

2024-02-27 16:09:43,Global Menstrual Cups Market Forecast Report 2018-2028: Increasing Consumer Demand for Eco-Friendly Feminine Hygiene Products Drives Robust Growth in the Menstrual Cups Industry,"Dublin, Feb.  27, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ”Menstrual Cups Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2018-2028F” report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com’s offering.
The global menstrual cups market is showcasing a notable expansion, with a surge in the market value reaching USD 1.1 billion in recent times and expected to persevere on an upward trajectory till 2028. The cumulative awareness of the environmental and health benefits of menstrual cups, coupled with the growing financial autonomy of women across the globe, is catalyzing the industry’s growth.
Menstrual cups are distinguished by their eco-friendliness and cost-efficiency compared to their disposables counterparts and are made from a variety of body-safe materials - including medical-grade silicone and latex - suitable for a wide array of body types and menstrual flows.
Menstrual Cups Gain Popularity as the Sustainable and Hygienic Alternative to Traditional Sanitary Products
Awareness and advocacy for environmental sustainability and women’s health have been the critical market drivers for the increased adoption of menstrual cups. Environmentally conscious consumers are proactively searching for sustainable alternatives to disposable sanitary products, leading to a higher demand for menstrual cups—a durable and less wasteful option. Health-conscious consumers are increasingly attentive to the risks presented by conventional menstrual products.
Women are now turning toward menstrual cups as a safer and more hygienic option due to their composition of hypoallergenic materials and lower associated health risks like Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). The growing cultural acceptance of menstrual cups and a general shift in consumer preferences towards comfort and convenience have further contributed to the widespread use of the product. The ability of menstrual cups to offer extended wear time and simplicity aligns well with modern lifestyle demands for time-saving and hassle-free solutions.
Expanding Product Accessibility and Diversity Reflect Progressive Inclusive Marketing
Addressing regional insights, North America maintains its dominance in the menstrual cups market due to heightened awareness, substantial women’s health campaigns, and disposable income availability. On the other hand, LAMEA regions demonstrate the fastest growth attributed to increasing initiatives aimed at educating and empowering women about menstrual health options.
The surge in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer models has significantly impacted the distribution of menstrual cups, making it easier for consumers to access and purchase them online. The convenience of online shopping, coupled with the benefits of DTC models, allows for intimate customer relations, fostering brand loyalty and a comprehensive understanding of consumer needs.
Market Segments Reflect Consumer Preferences and Industry Adaptation
Segmentation insights reveal that reusable menstrual cups dominate the market, favored for their longevity and eco-friendliness. The rise of reusable menstrual cups is a testament to the consumer shift towards sustainable and cost-saving menstrual solutions.
In terms of regional proliferation, North America leads the charge, with educational campaigns and a robust healthcare infrastructure contributing significantly to the market’s strength.

2024-02-26 17:42:45,"Ben King, Camille Trotman Named ACC Postgraduate Scholars"," THE FLATS – Georgia Tech student-athletes Ben King (baseball) and Camille Trotman (women’s track and field) have been named 2024 Atlantic Coast Conference Postgraduate Scholars, the ACC office announced on Monday. In addition, the league office unveiled the ACC Excellence Award winners. Representing Georgia Tech on the prestigious list are Christo Lamprecht (golf) and Carol Lee (women’s tennis). 
The ACC’s Weaver-James-Corrigan-Swofford postgraduate scholarship award recipients are selected for having performed with distinction both in the classroom and in their respective sport, while demonstrating exemplary conduct in the community. King and Trotman will receive $9,000 scholarships towards their postgraduate education following the conclusion of their respective collegiate playing careers. 
King carries a 4.0 cumulative grade point average as a biology major with plans to pursue medical school after graduation. Recently named to the inaugural Lou Gehrig Community Impact Team for his community impact, King is a baseball team captain this season. King has overcome injuries during his first two seasons to become the team’s most consistent pitcher last season. In 2023, he made 25 appearances and registered a 6-2 record with a 3.73 ERA. King is a four-time ACC Academic Honor Roll recipient and a member of the 2023 All-ACC Academic Team and CSC Academic All-District Team. 
Trotman has been a servant leader on the campus and in the community, while competing on Georgia Tech’s track and field team. A literature, media and communication major with a 3.61 GPA, Trotman has plans to pursue law school after graduation. Trotman has competed in over 30 meets, mainly in the high jump, and placed 10th in the 2023 ACC Outdoor Track and Field Championships with a personal-best mark. Off the track, Trotman has been heavily involved in the community as a member of the NAACP and Georgia Tech’s Student Government Association. Trotman has also excelled academically, earning ACC All-Academic Team honors, dean’s list recognition and faculty honors at Georgia Tech. 
In its inaugural year, the ACC Excellence Award is designed to highlight student-athletes that embody the student-athlete ideal – exemplary students, athletes, and contributors to the community and society. It was formally called the ACC Honorary Scholarship. 
The world’s No. 2-ranked amateur player, Lamprecht is a two-time GCAA All-American, Golfweek All-American and all-ACC. Lamprecht is ranked No. 2 this spring in the Scorecard collegiate rankings and in the PGA Tour University rankings. He also is on the watch list for the Ben Hogan Award, which recognizes the top men’s college golfer based on collegiate, amateur and professional events. In the last year, Lamprecht won The Amateur Championship and finished as the low amateur at The Open Championship. He also represented his home country of South Africa in the Arnold Palmer Cup and the World Amateur Team Championship. The senior Yellow Jacket won two collegiate fall events, the Olympia Fields/Fighting Illini Invitational and the Ben Hogan Collegiate Invitational. 
Lee was an ITA All-American singles competitor in 2023 after making a run to the quarterfinals of the NCAA Singles Championship and spending the entire season ranked in the top 16 nationally. The Jacket is a two-time all-ACC first team recipient in her collegiate career and earned ITA All-American status in doubles in 2022. She has amassed over 70 career singles wins and has led Georgia Tech from the top singles and doubles positions the last three seasons. Last season, Lee captured the ITA Southeast Regional doubles title with Kate Sharabura to clinch a spot in the ITA National Fall Championships. An outstanding competitor, Lee also excels in the classroom being named a three-time ITA Scholar-Athlete and ACC Academic Honor Roll recipient. 
The ACC has selected postgraduate scholarship recipients annually since 1971. Over that time, the league has provided nearly $4.7 million to more than 1,000 ACC student-athletes. Each member institution may nominate a maximum of two candidates and are recommended to nominate a student-athlete from one men’s and one women’s sport. 
Alexander-Tharpe Fund 
The Alexander-Tharpe Fund is the fundraising arm of Georgia Tech athletics, providing scholarship, operations and facilities support for Tech’s 400-plus student-athletes.

According to Shong, 21:9 is the aspect ratio of the future in a corporate setting. “What we’ve done for both traditional video and online collaboration platforms is opened up your field of view; taken away the dual monitors; and allowed it to be one big, continuous canvas that fills up the view of the person in front of you,” he said. 
And when it comes to enterprise displays, Rittenberg emphasized that there’s no reason they should be second rate. “We’re completely ahead of the entire market, and not just in 21:9, but the LCD display market,” he said. “We’re coming out with the Mini-LED backlight; Quantum-Dot (LED and our own dual brightness enhancement technology. We’re also reaching VESA DisplayHDR 1400, which has never happened in enterprise displays.”"

UK to spend GBP 245 million over next year to secure artillery ammunition for Ukraine
Peter Felstead
27. February 2024
The UK government announced on 24 February 2024 that it will spend GBP 245 million (EUR 286 million) throughout the next year to procure and invigorate supply chains to produce urgently needed artillery ammunition for Ukraine.
The announcement, which came exactly two years to the day since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his illegal full-scale invasion of Ukraine – noted that artillery has proved critical to Ukraine’s battlefield successes, continuously degrading Russian forces and preventing them from making significant breakthroughs.
“Ukraine has been particularly noted for its highly effective use of its artillery to conduct counter-battery fire – using drones and UK-supplied radar systems to quickly identify the locations of active Russian artillery and rapidly return fire to destroy them,” the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) noted in a press release.
“The UK has been leading international support for the armed forces of Ukraine (AFU) for 10 years since Russia first invaded Crimea in 2014, training more than 60,000 new recruits since 2015 and committing almost GBP 12 billion in economic, humanitarian and military aid since 2022,” the MoD added.
In an update to parliament on 22 February UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the delivery of an additional 200 Brimstone anti-tank missiles to the AFU, bringing the total number of Brimstone provided to Ukraine to more than 1,300. The MoD noted that this further builds on the country’s leading support for Ukraine; the UK was the first country to announce it would provide Ukraine with modern, Western armour in the form of Challenger 2 main battle tanks (MBTs) and was the first country to provide long-range precision strike capabilities in the form of Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles.
Further to the artillery funding and missiles package, a new multi-million-pound series of contracts has been signed between the MoD’s procurement arm, the Defence Equipment & Support (DE&S) organisation, and UK-based Cook Defence Systems to provide hundreds of spare caterpillar tracks for tanks and armoured vehicles. These will allow the AFU to recover and restore vehicles damaged by anti-tank weapons and land mines. The contracts will involve a mixture of UK funding and funds from the International Fund for Ukraine.
On 15 February Shapps announced that the UK will co-lead an international capability coalition to supply cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicles to Ukraine alongside Latvia, in addition to the UK’s co-leadership of the international Maritime Capability Coalition supporting Ukraine, which was announced in December 2023.
During meetings this month with counterparts at NATO headquarters in Brussels and at the Munich Security Conference, Shapps urged partners and allies to commit to long-term support for Ukraine, the MoD press release added.
The UK Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, was quoted by the MoD as saying, “During the past two years the Armed Forces of Ukraine have become one of the largest, most capable and respected fighting forces in the world. They have presided over extraordinary feats of operational and strategic success, from repelling Russian forces on the outskirts of Kyiv in the opening stages of the war to the spectacular and ongoing campaign in the Black Sea.
“Today the Russian Army has lost half the territory it seized, over 350,000 men killed or wounded, thousands of tanks, artillery pieces and armoured fighting vehicles; the Russian Fleet has been driven from Crimea and Ukraine’s maritime exports are returning to pre-war levels. Russia is failing in all of its strategic objectives to subjugate Ukraine and challenge NATO,” the CDS added.
“If we maintain the unity and cohesion we’ve seen to date, and keep strongly supporting our brave Ukrainian partners – militarily, economically and diplomatically – Russia will continue to fail and Ukraine will build the foundations to flourish as a strong, prosperous and sovereign nation. And NATO continues to get even stronger.”

February 27, 2024
0 Comments
Family Dollar agreed this week to pay $41.7 million for holding food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics under insanitary conditions at company’s West Memphis, Arkansas, distribution center.
A criminal information unveiled Feb. 26 in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, charged Family Dollar with one misdemeanor count of causing FDA-regulated products to become adulterated while being held under insanitary conditions. The company, a subsidiary of Dollar Tree Inc., entered into a plea agreement that constitutes the the largest-ever monetary criminal penalty in a food safety case.
“Companies distributing and selling food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics must ensure that these products are being held in safe and sanitary conditions,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will continue to work closely with the FDA to investigate and prosecute those who put public health at risk by failing to meet this important obligation.”
In pleading guilty, the company admitted that its Arkansas distribution center shipped FDA-regulated products to more than 400 Family Dollar stores in Alabama, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. According to the plea agreement, the company began receiving reports in August 2020 of mouse and pest issues with deliveries to stores.
By the end of 2020, certain stores reported receiving rodents and rodent-damaged products from the warehouse. The company admitted that by no later than January 2021, some of its employees were aware that the insanitary conditions caused FDA-regulated products held at the warehouse to become adulterated in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).
According to the plea agreement, the company continued to ship FDA-regulated products from the warehouse until January 2022, when an FDA inspection revealed live rodents, dead and decaying rodents, rodent feces, urine, and odors, and evidence of gnawing and nesting throughout the facility.
According to the plea agreement, subsequent fumigation of the facility resulted in the reported extermination of 1,270 rodents. On Feb. 18, 2022, the company voluntarily recalled all drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and human and animal food products sold since Jan. 1, 2021 in the 404 stores that had been serviced by the warehouse.

Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag after the Premier League match at Old Trafford, Manchester. Picture date: Saturday February 24, 2024. Mike Egerton - PA Images / PA Images via Getty Images 
La gestión de Erik ten Hag sigue dando bandazos en el timón del Manchester United. El neerlandés ha pasado de ser visto como el renovador de las esperanzas en Old Trafford al objeto número uno de las críticas en Inglaterra. Ahora, después de haber hilado nueve partidos sin perder, 8 de ellos con victoria, la derrota ante Fulham habría sido el detonante para que el nuevo dueño esté buscando un reemplazo que ponga fin a la inestabilidad. 
Según información del Daily Mail, Sir Jim Ratcliffe “está buscando reemplazos” para terminar la gestión de Erik ten Hag, quien ha perdido 15 partidos esta temporada, 10 de ellos en liga. El diario informa que grupo INEOS “no está completamente convencido” de mantener al técnico al frente y ya está barajeando opciones. 
Roberto de Zerbi ha vuelto a sonar en las oficinas de Manchester para ocupar el mando en el conjunto rojo. El problema principal con él es que también está en la lista de posibles sustitutos de Jürgen Klopp y Pep Guardiola, pero sin duda es la apuesta principal para suplir al neerlandés. 
La semana pasada, el propio Ten Hag había dicho que su relación con el empresario inglés era muy buena y que mantenían una comunicación estrecha. “Tenemos muchas conversaciones, tenemos la misma ambición, estamos muy alineados en el proceso. Encaja totalmente con las ambiciones que tengo y las que tenía cuando entré” , dijo Erik antes de la derrota del Fulham. 
A su vez, en una entrevista publicada por el United la semana pasada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe aceptó que el cambio constante de directores técnicos indicaba que el “medio ambiente” en el club era el culpable de la situación y aceptó que la continuidad del proyecto era clave. Aunque también fue claro en decir que había cosas qué modificar en una organización que “no estaba lista para tener éxito”. 
Este miércoles el Manchester United se enfrenta al Nottingham Forest en la quinta ronda de la FA Cup, el último tren de legitimidad que le queda a Erik ten Hag, que de perder, podría terminar de poner su firma en la carta de despedida."

2024-02-26 18:07:05,PHOTOS: Hall Named Honorary Georgia Tech Alumnus," THE FLATS – Georgia Tech head baseball coach Danny Hall was named an Honorary Georgia Tech Alumnus by the Georgia Tech Alumni Association on Feb. 15 at the Alumni Association’s 2024 White and Gold Honors Gala. 
Hall, in his 31st season heading the Tech program, joins an elite list of honorary alumni from Georgia Tech athletics, including Bruce Heppler, Bobby Cremins, Homer Rice and Bobby Dodd. 
“Words cannot describe how thrilled I am to be named an honorary alumnus at Georgia Tech,” Hall said. “My wife, Kara, and I have thoroughly enjoyed our time here and can safely call Georgia Tech and Atlanta home. My sons, Carter and Colin, have earned degrees for the Scheller College of Business and we are so proud to say that our sons are graduates and alumni. I have used the value of the Tech degree to lure some of the finest student-athletes in the country to The Flats. I’m humbled and proud to join this prestigious community.” 
Entering the 2024 season, the ABCA Hall of Famer has compiled a career record of 1,378-749-1 (.648) in 36 seasons as a head coach, including an 1,170-632-1 (.649) record in 30 seasons at Georgia Tech (1994-present). Hall’s 1,170 wins are the most in Tech history and the most among any active NCAA coach in the country. His .649 winning percentage on The Flats ranks second among Tech coaches with more than 700 games coached, behind only Morris (.674). Under Hall, the Yellow Jackets have compiled 15 40-win seasons and four 50-win seasons, including the school record 52-win campaign in 2002. 
“Congratulations to Coach Hall on this great, well-deserved honor,” Georgia Tech director of athletics J Batt said. “His 1,100-plus wins and the incredible number of All-Americans and Major Leaguers that he has produced at Georgia Tech speak for themselves. But what makes this honor so appropriate for Coach Hall is how he has represented the Institute and its ideals on and off the field during his tenure. I’m very happy for Georgia Tech athletics’ newest Tech alumnus, Danny Hall.” 
He has led the Jackets to its only three College World Series appearances (1994, 2002, 2006), 23 NCAA Regional appearances, and six NCAA Super Regional appearances. He’s been named ACC Coach of the Year four times, winning seven ACC regular season/divisional championships and five ACC Tournament championships. He was also named the Sporting News’ National Coach of the Year in 1997. 
Hall’s student-athletes have achieved tremendous success, having 139 Yellow Jackets drafted, including 15 first-round picks, and 32 of them playing in the Big Leagues. His players have earned 120 all-America honors, 140 all-ACC selections, and 28 freshman all-America awards. Not limited to just success on the playing field, Hall’s Jackets have also earned 19 academic all-American honors with more than 200 student-athletes named to the ACC academic honor roll. 
Alexander-Tharpe Fund 
The Alexander-Tharpe Fund is the fundraising arm of Georgia Tech athletics, providing scholarship, operations and facilities support for Tech’s 400-plus student-athletes. Be a part of the development of Yellow Jackets that thrive academically at the Institute and compete for championships at the highest levels of college athletics by supporting the Annual Athletic Scholarship Fund, which directly provides scholarships for Georgia Tech student-athletes.

2024-02-27 17:31:32,Some Livermore residents want Larimer County to pay for a 'character plan.' Here's why.,"Hide Caption
Here’s the stretch of U.S. 287 that will be rerouted for Glade Reservoir
A section of this 7-mile stretch of U.S. 287, north of Ted’s Place, will be underwater thanks to the planned Glade Reservoir as part of NISP.
Sady Swanson, Wochit
Some Livermore residents are asking Larimer County to fund a ”character plan” that would study potential land uses around The Forks Mercantile and Saloon — a store and restaurant at U.S. Highway 287 and County Road 74E — with the intent of creating a community vision for the future.
Commission Chairman John Kefalas and county planners will hold a town meeting Thursday, Feb. 29, at the Livermore Community Hall to get feedback from residents in the rural community. Larimer County has enough funding —about $50,000 — for one character study this year. Livermore would be competing with several other communities.
A character plan, Kefalas said, is a document intended to provide a framework ”for how Livermore wants to see itself in 10 years. It’s not about approving a specific land use proposal and not about adopting a proposed Livermore Rural Center plan.”
The Livermore Rural Center plan, prepared by Bob West, co-owner of The Forks; Cheryl Rennels, who owns a nearby ranch; and Zach Thode, Roberts Ranch manager, shows a desire to create a more reliable water source for the restaurant; Livermore Elementary, which trucks water to the school; the church and fire station.
But water systems are expensive and can’t occur without growth to help pay the costs. That’s the part that has inflamed some residents who say they have been excluded from discussions about the process and fear the rural center plan could lead to development of the mostly rural landscape. Currently, Livermore’s activity is centered around The Forks, post office, church, elementary school, county owned open space and a county maintenance facility on County Road 74E.
The plan suggests some housing, lodging such as short-term rentals and additional commercial space like a small grocery store, dental office and other services not currently available.
Thode described the rural center plan as ”just a request to start a rural center character plan.” The intent is to create a public process that creates a framework for what the future development of Livermore might look like, if it ever comes, he said. ”All of those things are potential ideas. Nowhere does it say this is a request for development ... it just says it’s an idea.”
The new maintenance facility prompted Thode and others to ask commissioners for a character plan study that would lay out a vision for the future especially as plans progress to realign U.S. 287 to accommodate the proposed Glade Reservoir as part of the Northern Integrated Supply Project . Any development plans that came forward after the character plan was adopted would have to comply with the plan’s vision, said Thode, a water engineer.
With the eventual construction of Glade Reservoir near Colorado Highway 14 and U.S. 287, Ted’s Place will be isolated to service Highway 14 and Poudre Canyon, according to the plan. ”There will be no current services between Laramie, Wyoming and Fort Collins (about 66 miles) except for The Forks.”
Not all owners of The Forks are on board with development plans.
Longtime Livermore residents Danette and Mike Meyer, who own about 25% of the Forks, said in an email: ”We don’t believe this development plan should be associated with the Forks as not all owners are supportive. While we appreciate the need for a sustainable water source in the valley, we are not supportive of significant development of the Livermore valley to achieve those aims. We are supportive of a community led character study where all community members have a say in how or, most importantly, if they want to see Livermore grow.”  
Wells were polluted by a diesel spill on county property in the 1970s that has caused water issues ever since. As a result of a lawsuit, the county funded the Livermore Water Association, which developed a new water system for five properties from a shallow well and buried collection tank. Water is sent through a filtration system and on to users. ”The water source is a bit unreliable and extremely expensive for water users,” Thode said.
”The fire station, school and church have substandard water supplies,” the trio wrote in the rural center plan submitted to the county.
Without a new water source, it is unlikely any land use change will be possible, according to the rural center plan. Several people within the Livermore Water Association researched possible water alternatives due to the increased costs of the existing system and may have a future source, according to the plan document.
There is a more reliable water source, Kefalas said. ”To drill that water and move it to the community village would require more development.” The meeting, however, won’t address water issues. ”The purpose of the meeting is to explain to a larger audience what the county’s role is and an opportunity to develop a character plan. The character area plan creates a framework of what people want to see in the broader area five to 10 years from now with the realignment of 287, public safety issues on 287, etc.”
In November,  the Coloradoan reported that the 30-mile stretch from Colorado Highway 14 to the Wyoming state line had seen 15 fatalities in the last 11 years , including three in 2023.
Creating an area plan ”has been an issue since I’ve been a commissioner,” Kefalas said. ”We want to support efforts to do future planning and sustainability, but for lots of reasons we haven’t had the capacity or resources to do that.” Although other communities will be vying for funding, Kefalas said he believes ”Livermore is a higher priority.”
Want to go?
The meeting with Commissioner John Kefalas and county planners will be from 5:30-7 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 29, at Livermore Community Hall, 2044 W.County Road 74E, Livermore."

2024-02-27 17:15:00,CHEMSTREAM INC. ANNOUNCES FULL COMPLIANCE WITH HISTORIC RADICAL TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE," HOMER CITY, Pa., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Chemstream Inc., in conjunction with CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX), announced it has become the first service provider to fully comply with the historic Radical Transparency initiative, which was launched as part of the collaboration between CNX and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s Administration in November 2023. 
Across the company, Chemstream, a leading specialty chemical manufacturing and distribution company that supports a wide range of industries, has been working to ensure their robust chemical additive disclosures rapidly meet the high standards of this commitment to heighten operational transparency, including chemical use, in collaboration with state environmental regulators and the public. 
Previously, Chemstream had several chemicals with components listed as ”proprietary” in disclosures. In an effort to mirror unprecedented access to real-time chemical data used in oil and gas development, these particular chemicals will no longer have components listed as such, regardless of the operator Chemstream is servicing. 
”For years, we have had an exceptional partnership with CNX and are excited to stand beside CNX and the Shapiro Administration in this first-of-its-kind initiative now and in the future,” says Dave McCombie, President of Chemstream. ”Chemstream is very intentional about how we conduct business because of our longstanding and special relationship with the communities and people where we live and work.” 
Chemstream is committed to being a sustainable organization for the future and a leader in the specialty chemical industry by meeting the toughest ethical and legal standards. This announcement, which will apply company-wide, is the latest example of this business mindset in action. 
”We’re on a mission to move beyond political rhetoric and sensationalism to ensure that public policy decisions around energy and environmental issues in the Commonwealth are grounded in facts and data,” says Nick Deiuliis, President and CEO of CNX Resources. ”The Chemstream team is the first to step up to join our Radical Transparency efforts, but we know they won’t be the last. We look forward to working together to change the debate by open sourcing real-time data for all to see, and creating an atmosphere of transparency and mutual trust which can serve as the basis for cooperation and real environmental and economic progress.” 
”It has long been a priority for environmental advocates, community leaders, and Pennsylvanians in communities across the Commonwealth to know exactly what chemicals are being used in the natural gas drilling process. Chemstream is a significant provider of those chemicals and well pad services in Pennsylvania and around the country — and they have agreed to total and complete transparency of those chemicals, in line with our collaboration with CNX,” said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. ”My Administration has been aggressively engaging with other companies to join with CNX and Chemstream for greater transparency, and to better protect public health and safety.” 
About Chemstream 
Established in 1997, Chemstream, Inc. is a nationwide leading chemical company.

2024-02-27 17:17:51,UPDATE 1-POLISH PM CONSIDERS WIDER BAN ON UKRAINIAN FOOD IMPORTS AS FARMERS PROTEST," (Recasts paragraph 1-2,5-7 with Tusk’s comments in Prague, adds estimated number of protesters in paragraph 8) 
WARSAW, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday he could not rule out widening a national ban on imports of Ukrainian grains to other products if the European Union does not act to protect the bloc’s markets. 
Tusk made the remarks during a visit to Prague as thousands of Polish farmers took to the streets of Warsaw, carrying the national flag and blowing handheld horns, escalating a protest against food imports from Ukraine and EU green rules. 
Farmers across Europe have been protesting for weeks against constraints placed on them by the EU’s ’Green Deal’ regulations meant to tackle climate change, as well as rising costs and what they say is unfair competition from outside the EU, particularly Ukraine. 
Poland last year extended a ban on Ukrainian grain imports. 
”We are talking about it with the Ukrainian side - that it will be necessary to expand the embargo to other products if the European Union does not find more effective ways to protect the European and Polish markets,” Tusk said on Tuesday. 
Earlier in the day, Tusk said that the EU had to solve the problems created by its decision to open its borders to imports of Ukrainian food products after Russia invaded its neighbour in early 2022. 
He added that Poland was ready to co-finance purchases of Polish, European and Ukrainian food and agricultural products to be sent as humanitarian aid to famine-stricken countries, and that ”Europe should certainly find funds for this.” 
Back home, farmers rallied in central Warsaw before marching towards parliament and then Tusk’s office. A city hall official cited by PAP state news agency put the number of protesters around 10,000. 
”We are protesting because we want the ’green deal’ to be lifted, as it will lead our farms to bankruptcy with its costs... that are not comparable to what we harvest and to what we are paid,” said Kamil Wojciechowski, 31, a farmer from Izbica Kujawska in central Poland. 
”And ... what we’re paid for our work, it has decreased because of the influx of grain from Ukraine and this is our second demand - to block the influx of grain from Ukraine.” 
The farmers began a series of protests throughout the country earlier this month, which included a near-total blockade of all Ukrainian border crossings, as well as disruptions at ports and on roads nationwide. 
”We won’t give up. We have no choice. Our farms will go bankrupt, we will lose our livelihoods,” Pawel Walkowiak, 47, a corn and wheat producer from Konarzewo in western Poland said. 
The city hall official said Tuesday’s protest in Warsaw took place without major incidents.

Clarity in drafting patent claims has always been a serious issue: clarity is required to distinguish the subject matter of a claim from prior art, and an unclear claim can be interpreted to the disadvantage of the applicant or proprietor. This is not just a formal matter, but a substantial issue of first importance. 
The ’problem-solution’ approach is not officially part of the EPC, but is a criterion which has been developed by case law. It is now hard to find a decision of the Boards of Appeal which does not rely on the problem-solution approach in order to decide upon an inventive steps. It looks easy, but when applied, it should be applied correctly. 
The purpose of this seminar is to teach delegates the essentials of clarity and the most effective use of the problem-solution approach, giving them an edge over other parties.

2024-02-27 17:27:00,JOURNEY OF A GERM: NEW STUDY REVEALS BACKPACKS CAN HARBOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GERMS," PARSIPPANY, N.J., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A new scientific study by Reckitt’s Lysol Pro Solutions has revealed the risks that can be posed by the everyday objects we carry with us throughout the working day when it comes to accumulating illness-causing germs in business environments. A short video has been released to accompany the findings, which can be viewed HERE. 
The results from the study revealed that objects such as backpacks picked up: 
”Germs are everywhere,” said Dr. Igor Ignatovich, Senior Microbiologist within the Equity, Claims, and Compliance Group at Reckitt. ”They move among people and on surfaces, sometimes causing illnesses that could impact our families or impact our daily activities. Items we least suspect can often be culprits for spreading germs, as shown by our study.” 
In the study, Lysol Pro Solutions’ team of microbiologists, led by Dr. Ignatovich, measured the contamination levels on the backpacks of five different volunteers as they moved through business facilities throughout the day. Backpacks were chosen to represent how similar everyday items can be responsible for transmitting germs. The backpacks came into contact with a surface for about two minutes, three times a day for two days. The following surfaces were used: the communal bathroom floor, the work desk, and the cafeteria floor. 
”The results demonstrate that using a backpack throughout the day leads to the accumulation of a significant number of germs,” continued Dr. Ignatovich. ”Like many other items we carry with us each day, these could be significant vectors of germ transmission. Using effective cleaning and disinfecting products to make the right hygiene interventions, at the right time, and in the right places, can help break the chain of transmission and prevent the spread of germs between surfaces in business environments and homes, and to humans directly.” 
Experts such as Lysol Pro Solutions can provide an understanding of different germs and how they spread via surfaces and objects such as backpacks, so businesses can deploy effective products and protocols that help protect against cold, flu, and a broad range of other common workplace viruses and bacteria. 
Reckitt’s Lysol Pro Solutions harnesses the power of Lysol to help protect businesses and public spaces from the spread of germs. In today’s world, consumers have increased hygiene expectations which makes germ-protection more critical than ever. The comprehensive approach from Lysol Pro Solutions incorporates science-backed protocols and training, EPA-approved Lysol products and Lysol-branded marketing materials and signage. Lysol Pro Solutions empowers businesses to demonstrate to their staff and customers a commitment to providing a trusted standard for protection. 
Reckitt* exists to protect, heal and nurture in the pursuit of a cleaner, healthier world. We believe that access to the highest-quality hygiene, wellness and nourishment is a right, not a privilege.

2024-02-27 17:20:09,Two mayoral hopefuls murdered in same Mexican city," Gunmen have killed two aspiring candidates to be mayor of the same Mexican city, authorities said Tuesday, underlining the dangers of running for office in the violence-plagued Latin America nation. 
Mexican politicians, particularly at the local level, frequently fall victim to bloodshed connected to corruption and the multibillion-dollar narcotics trade. 
Attacks usually increase in the run-up to elections -- and this year is no exception. 
On Monday, two mayoral hopefuls were murdered on the same day in Maravatio in the western state of Michoacan, one of Mexico’s most violent regions. 
Miguel Angel Reyes Zavala, who aspired to be the candidate of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s Morena party, was shot dead in his vehicle outside the clinic where he worked, the state prosecutor’s office said. 
Two hitmen opened fire at point-blank range before fleeing in a car, according to testimonies collected by investigators. 
Hours later, Armando Perez Luna, who hoped to represent the opposition National Action Party (PAN), was found dead in a car with gunshot wounds, the prosecutor’s office said. 
PAN condemned the ”cowardly murders” of the politicians and said that it had ”warned months ago” of the need to step up security in the region. 
Since last June, more than 30 people have been murdered in election-related violence in Mexico, of whom 16 were aspiring candidates, according to research firm Laboratorio Electoral. 
Mexico has recorded more than 420,000 murders since launching a controversial anti-drug military operation in 2006, most of them blamed on fighting between criminals, according to official figures. 
The country will hold presidential, legislative and local elections on June 2.

Demonstrators hoped nationwide protests called by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) umbrella union would pile pressure on the government, which brought in reforms last year that have had a devastating effect on citizens of Africa’s biggest economy. 
As inflation skyrockets, many poor Nigerians have had to skip meals and give up products such as meat, eggs and milk. 
Over 1,000 demonstrators marched on the National Assembly in the capital Abuja, watched over by vigilante groups and armed police. 
The protesters chanted and carried signs saying ”Let the poor breathe” and ”End naira devaluation”. 
”The government needs to wake up,” said protester Roland Bamiche, who works for a hospitality union. 
”People are dying, people are suffering, people are going through hell,” the 45-year-old said. ”The high cost of living is becoming unbearable.” 
Since coming to office last year President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has ended a fuel subsidy and currency controls, leading to a tripling of petrol prices and a spike in living costs as the naira has slid against the dollar. 
The inflation rate reached a three-decade high of almost 30 percent in January, according to the national bureau of statistics. 
Tinubu has called for patience to allow his reforms to take effect, saying they will help attract foreign investment, but the measures have hit Nigerians hard. 
”Tinubu promised a change but now look where we are,” said activist Aghedo Kehinde Stephen in Lagos where more than 1,000 people also turned out. 
”There is no food and no security in the country.” 
- ’Reduced to beggars’ - 
In the north, the economic crisis has forced people to eat poor-grade rice used as fish food. 
To feed their children, women have even resorted to digging up anthills in search of grain stored by the insects, videos on social media show. 
Hundreds of demonstrators marched to the governor’s office in the northern city of Kano, the capital of a key state which also bears the same name. 
”The population has been reduced to beggars. The government must take drastic measures,” said protester Saudatu Ibrahim. 
The government says it is working to address the crisis and on Tuesday Nigeria’s central bank announced it was raising interest rates by four percentage points to 22.75 percent in a bid to tame inflation. 
”We need prices to come down,” said NLC worker Mercy Adeyemi at the Abuja demonstration. 
The price of rice has more than doubled in the past year and the 48-year-old mother of four said she has been missing meals to make ends meet. 
Protests have already taken place across the country this month and are set to continue tomorrow.

2024-02-27 17:26:20,UKRAINE SAYS RUSSIA WILL STEP UP ITS HYBRID ATTACKS IN SPRING," KYIV, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Russia will escalate an ongoing influence operation this spring aimed at destabilising Ukraine and scuppering international support for Kyiv in its two-year-old war with Moscow, Ukrainian intelligence warned on Tuesday. 
Ukraine is struggling to fend off Russian troops along much of the front line as Kyiv faces challenges in replenishing its ranks and a potential cut in U.S. military aid. 
The Kremlin will bolster its invasion by stepping up efforts to seed disinformation on social media, sparking conflict among Ukrainians and sowing doubt among Kyiv’s allies of its chances for victory, according to a presidential intelligence committee. 
”During the coming weeks the enemy will make every effort to spread narratives that are destructive to world security and attempt to incite conflicts - both inside Ukraine and in other parts of the world where there is support for Ukraine,” it said. 
There was no immediate comment from Russia about the statement. The Kremlin said earlier this week that Ukraine had been receiving help from the CIA to counter Russia for more than a decade. 
Russia casts its invasion as an attempt to ”de-nazify” Ukraine, which it claims was taken over by ”fascists” after a pro-democracy revolution in 2014 that ousted a Moscow-backed president. 
Kyiv and its international partners say the war is part of a years-long hybrid effort by Moscow to subjugate Ukraine as it embraces the West. 
In a statement carried by Kyiv’s domestic security and military spy agencies, the committee said the operation would culminate in late May, when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s five-year-mandate would normally run out. 
Elections in Ukraine are suspended under martial law, which has been in effect since Russia’s invasion. 
”The methodology of the campaign is typical for Russian special services: to question the legitimacy of government decisions made in Ukraine after May 20, to spread panic and despair, to artificially pit civilians against the military, to make us quarrel with our allies, to spread all kinds of ’conspiracy theories’ in society,” it said. 
It added that Russian forces would attempt to exploit the situation to inflict a battlefield loss in the east. 
Zelenskiy warned earlier this week that Russian forces, which recently captured the strategic city of Avdiivka, could attempt another offensive in late May or early summer. (Reporting by Dan Peleschuk; Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)"
2024-02-27 17:24:27,"POST OFFICE CHIEF EXECUTIVE WAS CLOSE TO RESIGNING OVER PAY, EX-CHAIRMAN CLAIMS"," The former chairman of the Post Office has claimed the organisation’s current chief executive was going to resign because he was “unhappy with his pay”. 
A source at the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) confirmed an investigation is ongoing into Nick Read after Henry Staunton told MPs of an 80-page report compiled by the organisation’s HR director. 
Mr Staunton gave evidence to MPs on Tuesday where he said former business secretary Grant Shapps had told him about Mr Read’s pay: “Don’t even think of coming for any salary increase.” 
The former chairman said the Post Office boss “fell out” with the business’s HR director and said that his own behaviour was only referenced once in the 80-page document about Mr Read. 
He told the Business and Trade Committee on Tuesday that he has been the victim of a “smear campaign” since his public fallout with Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch. 
Mr Staunton previously claimed he had been told to delay payouts to subpostmasters affected by problems with the Horizon computer system. 
It opened a row with Ms Badenoch, who accused him of spreading “made-up anecdotes”. 
Following the evidence heard by the committee, a source at the DBT said: “The department was aware that Nick Read was also under investigation, although we have not seen the 80-page report referred to by Henry Staunton and cannot attest to the content. 
“The Secretary of State was clear in her statement to the House of Commons on February 19 that she lost confidence in Mr Staunton because he was blocking an investigation into his conduct, as well as his attempt to bypass the formal process to appoint a new director to the board. 
“It was these issues, as well as overall concerns about his grip on the post office – demonstrated by his discredited newspaper interview and the manner in which his story has changed in the following days – that led to his sacking. 
“The department will await the outcome of the investigation into Mr Read before making any further judgement.” 
Asked if he was informed that his behaviour was under investigation in November last year, Mr Staunton said: “What there is, actually, is Mr Read fell out with his HR director and she produced a ‘speak up’ document which was 80 pages thick. 
“Within that, was one paragraph… about comments that I allegedly made. 
“So this is an investigation, not into me, this is an investigation made into the chief executive Nick Read. 
“That one paragraph you could say was about politically incorrect comments attributed to me which I strenuously deny. 
“This was not an investigation into me, this was an investigation based on the 80-page document prepared by the HR director.” 
Mr Staunton continued: “This 80-page document was actually taking a terrible toll on Nick Read. 
“He said: ‘I’m not being supported by the board, this is just bad news for me and my family, I’m going to resign tomorrow, I’ve just had enough.” 
Asked to confirm that he had had a verbal conversation in which Mr Read had announced his intention to resign, Mr Staunton said: “The 80-page report alleges, from the HR director, not my words, that Nick was going to resign because he was unhappy with this pay. 
“She’s put that in this document.” 
Labour’s MP for Wansbeck Ian Lavery asked: “Are you sure?” 
Mr Staunton replied: “I’m absolutely positive.” 
Going on to address conversations between Mr Read and himself, Mr Staunton told MPs: “I think he was doing fine. Huge, huge pressures on him. 
“I must have had four conversations when he said he was going to chuck it in. 
“And my job was just to be someone that would understand the pressures that he was on, because I think it would be very difficult to find a replacement at this stage with the business in the state that it’s in. 
“If I didn’t think he was doing satisfactorily, I’d have asked to change things.” 
He added: “I got a strong message from Mr (Grant) Shapps when he was Secretary of State: Don’t even think of coming for any salary increase. I got a strong message from minister (Kevin) Hollinrake. 
“I said to him: ‘Nick is unhappy with the salary.’ He said: ‘Don’t waste a postage stamp coming to talk to me about it.’” 
Mr Staunton stepped down from the Post Office amid ongoing tensions last month. 
Since then he has claimed that in a meeting with former Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) permanent secretary Sarah Munby he was told to “hobble” into the next general election, according to notes reported by The Times newspaper. 
Speaking about his fallout with the Business Secretary, Mr Staunton said: “We all know that things were moving far too slowly … and the reason why people have latched onto what I said in the Sunday Times was that finally someone was being honest about how deep-seated the problems were and why nothing was being done,” he told MPs on the Business and Trade Committee. 
“I still think that more could be done, at least to make compensation more generous, and the process of getting justice less bureaucratic. 
“But I will at least have achieved something if the sunlight of disinfectant, which the Secretary of State so approves of, means that Government now lives up to its promises. 
“What the public wants to know is: why was everything so slow? … And why does everything remain so slow? I’ve spoken up on matters of genuine public concern, have been fired, and am now subject to a smear campaign.” 
The Horizon IT scandal saw more than 700 subpostmasters prosecuted by the Post Office and handed criminal convictions between 1999 and 2015 as Fujitsu’s faulty Horizon system made it appear as though money was missing at their branches. 
Hundreds of subpostmasters are still awaiting compensation despite the Government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts."

2024-02-27 17:22:06,Central Europe PMs say will not send troops to Ukraine," Four ex-communist central European countries said Tuesday they were not planning to send troops to Ukraine as they remained torn on military aid to the war-ravaged country battling Russia’s invasion. 
The Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Slovak prime ministers spoke one day after French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out the dispatch of Western ground troops to Ukraine ”to ensure that Russia cannot win this war”. 
Prague and Warsaw are calling for increased military aid to Ukraine, while Bratislava and Budapest are against. 
But all four EU and NATO members forming the so-called Visegrad Group said they would not send ground troops to Ukraine. 
”We are not considering sending our troops to Ukraine and we have a common position on this point” with the Czech Republic, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said after meeting Czech counterpart Petr Fiala for bilateral talks in Prague. 
”Today, we have to concentrate, like the Polish and Czech governments have done, on supporting Ukraine fully in its military effort,” Tusk added. 
The two leaders spoke of their ”common point of view” on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Tusk promised to support a Czech plan for several NATO members to jointly buy ammunition for Kyiv from third countries. 
”If all EU countries were committed in helping Ukraine like Poland and the Czech Republic, then it would not be necessary to discuss other forms of support for Ukraine,” he added. 
- Common past - 
At a Visegrad Group press conference later in Prague, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that ”as regards Hungary, we are sending neither weapons nor soldiers over”. 
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that at the Paris conference hosted by Macron on Monday, there were ”prime ministers who said they were ready to discuss it and then prime ministers and heads of state who rejected the idea on principle”. 
”We reject it on principle,” added Fico. 
Orban blocked a 50-billion-euro EU aid package for Ukraine for months while Fico has refused to provide military aid to the country, questioning its sovereignty and calling for peace with Russia. 
Also in Prague, Tusk and Fiala expressed their support for the idea of seizing Russian funds around the world, which they said were worth around $300 billion. They said this could be used to support Ukraine financially. 
Speaking alongside Orban and Fico, Tusk recalled the common past the four countries had as satellites of the Soviet Union until 1989. 
”If we accepted Moscow’s point of view... the one Putin is presenting, then neither Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary nor Poland would be independent states, and we would still be living under occupation,” Tusk said. 
The Visegrad Group was founded in 1991, two years after Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland shed the totalitarian communist rule of four decades. 
Czechoslovakia split peacefully into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.

2024-02-27 17:21:00,/C O R R E C T I O N -- VETCOMM/," In the news release, Empowering Veterans: VetComm Shines a Spotlight on Billions of Dollars Unclaimed Annually, issued 27-Feb-2024 by VetComm over PR Newswire, we are advised that additional information about the company, including the stock ticker was added. The complete, corrected release follows: 
The veterans-first organization rallies 11 million eligible veterans to claim their rightful service-related disability benefits 
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- In a revelation that demands attention, VetComm, a leading provider of innovative solutions for veterans, sheds light on the startling truth that billions of dollars earmarked for approximately 11 million eligible veterans remain unclaimed each year. In San Diego alone, a city with a profound military heritage, an average of $4.5 billion annually goes unutilized by veterans who are unaware of their entitlements. 
Kate Monroe, CEO and Founder of VetComm and a 100% rated USMC disabled veteran, passionately stated, ”As a Marine Corps veteran, I understand the sacrifices our servicemen and women make. Every unclaimed dollar is a missed opportunity! VetComm is here to break through the barriers, eliminate the red tape and ensure that no veteran is left behind in claiming what is rightfully theirs. It’s not just about the money; it’s about honoring and recognizing the commitment and sacrifices made for our country.” 
A profound challenge lies in the fact that many veterans, despite being eligible, refrain from claiming their rightful benefits. VetComm identifies three primary reasons for this oversight. Firstly, a significant number of veterans feel undeserving of the financial support to which they are entitled. Secondly, numerous attempts to apply are thwarted by bureaucratic hurdles, with paperwork often denied due to inaccuracies. Lastly, a considerable portion of veterans is unaware that they can even apply for these funds. 
On average, each eligible veteran misses out on an astonishing $500,000 to $1 million in unclaimed benefits. VetComm emphasizes that a veteran with a 100% disability rating, for example, who applied at the age of 40, could receive a life-changing $2.1 million. Even at a 50% service-connected disability rating, monthly compensation starts at $958.44, with additional benefits such as no-cost VA health care and prescription medications under Priority Group 1. Veterans may also qualify for concurrent retirement and disability pay, or combat-related special compensation for those receiving military retirement pay and aged 60 or older. 
VetComm was founded to assist veterans and stands at the forefront of advocating for veterans’ rights. The organization is committed to empowering veterans with the education and resources needed to access their entitled benefits. VetComm believes that every veteran deserves to receive their rightful benefits and provides a comprehensive education and support platform to ensure this becomes a reality. Its mission is clear – prevent the reallocation of funds earmarked for veterans by empowering them to claim the benefits they rightfully deserve. 
For more information on VetComm and its initiatives, including how to learn more about receiving benefits, please visit VetComm.us. 
VetComm’s mission is to empower United States veterans by providing them with the education and resources they need to access the benefits they are entitled to but not presently receiving. Founded by United States Marine Corps veteran Kate Monroe, VetComm is dedicated to advocating for veterans and ensuring they receive the support they need to thrive after serving our country. 
VetComm believes that every veteran deserves to receive the benefits they are entitled to and is committed to providing a comprehensive education and support platform to help them do just that. With the tools provided by VetComm, veterans can get rated and claim the benefits they deserve, preventing the reallocation of funds by the U.S. government to other budget line items and making sure that those who have served their country receive the support they need to lead fulfilling lives.

2024-02-27 17:26:00,UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS CANADA ELECTS NEW NATIONAL PRESIDENT," UFCW Canada National President Shawn Haggerty 
TORONTO, Feb. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Canada has elected a new national president. Shawn Haggerty, a well-known long-time labour activist, has been elected the national president of Canada’s leading and most progressive private sector union, with more than 250,000 members across Canada. In addition, Haggerty has been elected executive vice president of UFCW International, as part of the senior leadership team of a union of 1.3 million members in the U.S. and Canada. 
Haggerty’s activism in the labour movement spans decades, when he first became a member of UFCW Local 416P while working as an electrician in the maintenance department at Robin Hood Multi-Foods in Port Colborne, Ontario. 
In 2007, Haggerty was elected president of UFCW 175, which is the largest local union in Canada, a role which he remained in for 17 years. He became a UFCW Canada national council vice president in 2007, and in 2019, he was elected UFCW International vice president. 
“Shawn has spent his lifetime committed to building a better life for workers, and his decades of experience of a union leader and labour activist makes him the right person to fight the battles modern labour is facing,” says UFCW International President Marc Perrone. “On behalf of UFCW International, we congratulate Shawn, and look forward to working with him to continue improving the lives of our members across North America.” 
“I am honoured by the confidence of UFCW Canada and UFCW International in entrusting me in this role,” says President Haggerty. “I have dedicated my career to building a better life for UFCW workers and commit to building upon the excellent work that UFCW activists have achieved over the years. Together, our union family will continue to advance fairness, equality and social justice for our members and all workers.” 
Haggerty’s election follows the retirement announcement of the previous UFCW Canada national president, Paul Meinema, who retired after over four decades of dedicated service to the labour movement. 
In addition to his new responsibilities as national president of UFCW Canada, Haggerty sits as a trustee on several benefit plan boards, and he also serves as UFCW’s leading voice on the Canadian Labour Congress’s executive council.

2024-02-27 17:17:23,CONGO JOINS LNG-EXPORTING NATIONS UNDER A NEW PROJECT WITH ITALIAN ENERGY COMPANY ENI," MILAN (AP) — The African nation of Congo became the latest exporter of liquified natural gas on Tuesday as it launched production of the first cargo load a year after Italian energy company ENI launched the Congo LNG project with local partners. 
The first cargo ship laden with LNG will head to the Italian regassification plant in the Tuscan city of Piombino in the coming days, ENI said in a statement. 
“With the first cargo, the Republic of Congo enters the group of LNG exporting countries, opening up opportunities for economic growth while contributing to the global energy balance,” ENI said. 
ENI and it partners shared workforces, know-how and technology “ensuring additional revenues to the country while contributing to Europe’s energy security,” CEO Claudio Descalzi said in a statement. 
The project will have an annual capacity of 4.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas, which is used to heat homes and businesses. It is formed when gas is cooled to about -260 F (-162 C) to be stored and shipped safely aboard specially designed vessels. 
Europe has been in search of new energy sources since moving to cut off Russian supplies following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Sales of Russian gas abroad have dropped by 40% since the invasion, according to the ISPI think tank."

(BOURSE:SGRO) 
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN ARE NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, JAPAN OR ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL 
FURTHER, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT AN OFFER OF SECURITIES IN ANY JURISDICTION 
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
27 February 2024 
SEGRO PLC 
PLACING TO FUND PROFITABLE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES 
SEGRO plc (”SEGRO” or the ”Company” or the ”Group”) today announces its intention to conduct a placing to raise approximately £800 million of gross proceeds through the issue of new ordinary shares of 10 pence per share (the ”Placing Shares”) in the capital of the Company (the ”Placing”). 
In addition to the Placing, there will be a separate offer made by the Company of new ordinary shares of 10 pence each in the capital of the Company (the ”Retail Offer Shares”) at the Placing Price (as defined below) (the ”Retail Offer”), to provide retail investors in the UK only with an opportunity to acquire Retail Offer Shares. A separate announcement will be made shortly regarding the Retail Offer and its terms. 
Highlights 
Background to the Placing and Retail Offer 
SEGRO owns and manages one of the highest quality, best located and most modern portfolios of industrial and logistics space in Europe, covering 10.4 million square metres of space, valued at £20.7 billion as at 31 December 2023 (£17.8 billion including joint ventures at share). Two-thirds of this portfolio comprises urban warehouses (and data centres) concentrated in and around Europe’s major cities, where supply of modern warehouse space vital to servicing growing populations and the digital economy is particularly constrained. The remaining one-third of the portfolio consists of big box warehouses, located at key logistics hubs, which are used for large-scale centralised distribution and fulfilment. 
Occupier markets have remained favourable through the recent period of macroeconomic uncertainty due to the continued presence of long-term structural drivers. These include the explosion of data and the digitalisation of business and society, including continued growth in e-commerce volumes and demand for data centres (for which the EMEA market is expected to triple in size by 2028, according to research by JLL); supply chain optimisation to drive cost savings, improve customer service and provide greater resilience; increased focus on sustainability; and urbanisation – the long-term trend for urban population growth which creates greater demand for warehouse space, whilst reducing the supply of available land. 
Vacancy levels remain low across SEGRO’s chosen sub-markets and a lack of available land and difficult planning processes, as well as increased funding costs and reduced availability of development financing, limit the potential supply response and have already resulted in a significant reduction in speculative construction starts in the UK and other markets. This supply-demand tension is expected to drive further rental growth in line with SEGRO’s medium-term expectations of between two and six per cent per annum. 
SEGRO believes that market expectations for lower interest rates, if sustained, should provide a positive backdrop for a recovery of investment market sentiment as the year progresses, with the industrial and logistics sector likely to recover more quickly than wider real estate assets due to the strong fundamentals and positive rental growth outlook. In addition, after a period of elevated inflation, construction costs are moderating which, when combined with continued strong demand and limited new supply, create supportive conditions for development at attractive returns. 
Use of the proceeds of the Placing and Retail Offer 
SEGRO last raised equity in June 2020. Since then it has deployed £2.2 billion in development capital expenditure (including on infrastructure), £3.1 billion on acquisitions (including land purchases) and made disposals of £1.4 billion. This Placing and the Retail Offer will provide SEGRO with additional capital and the flexibility to accelerate existing, and pursue additional, development-led growth opportunities, and to take advantage of potential acquisition opportunities which may arise, whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Development pipeline 
SEGRO is currently onsite with, is in the final stages of, or has signed contracts for, development projects equating to £71 million of headline rent and which require capital expenditure of £342 million to complete them. Once fully let, these projects are expected to deliver a yield on total development cost (including land) of 7.4 per cent, or a 12.1 per cent yield on new money (i.e. total development costs excluding land already on the balance sheet). 
In addition to these immediate projects, SEGRO has a sizeable land bank on which it expects to commence development over the next five to seven years, requiring £3.5 billion of further investment and delivering over £370 million of potential headline rent based on current rental levels and costs. 
SEGRO therefore expects to invest approximately £600 million on development and infrastructure this year and a similar amount in 2025, with significant flexibility to accelerate this in response to occupier demand. The Group believes it is very well placed to take advantage of the increasing number of development opportunities that are expected to emerge as the macroeconomic environment improves and the supply of new, sustainable warehousing remains constrained. 
Acquisitions of investment assets 
SEGRO continues to focus most of its capital investment on its development programme. However, it also expects to see the emergence of potentially attractive asset acquisition opportunities in line with SEGRO’s investment criteria in terms of returns, location and quality. 
Availability and cost of financing represents a challenge for many market participants, which provides SEGRO with a competitive advantage given its strong balance sheet, significant liquidity and its unsecured funding model. This is in addition to SEGRO’s other longstanding competitive advantages, including extensive in-country experience, a wide network of local stakeholder contacts and access to off-market transactions. 
Shareholder Consultation 
The Company has consulted with a number of its leading shareholders regarding the rationale for the Placing and the Retail Offer and their non-pre-emptive nature, ahead of this Announcement. Feedback from this consultation was supportive and, as a result, the Board’s firm belief is that the Placing and the Retail Offer are in the best interests of shareholders and will promote the success of the Company. 
The proposed issue and allotment of the Placing Shares and the Retail Offer Shares is within the existing shareholder authorities granted to the Company at its most recent Annual General Meeting held on 20 April 2023. 
Details of the Placing 
Morgan Stanley & Co International plc (”Morgan Stanley”) and UBS AG London Branch (”UBS”, and together with Morgan Stanley, the ”Joint Bookrunners”) are acting as Joint Bookrunners and Corporate Brokers in connection with the Placing. Barclays Bank PLC (”Barclays”) and BNP PARIBAS (”BNPP”) are acting as co-bookrunners in connection with the Placing (Barclays and BNPP together, the ”Co-Bookrunners” and together with the Joint Bookrunners, the ”Banks”). 
The Placing is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this announcement (which forms part of this announcement, such announcement and the Appendix together being the ”Announcement”). The Joint Bookrunners will today commence a bookbuilding process in respect of the Placing (the ”Bookbuild”). The price per ordinary share at which the Placing Shares are to be placed (the ”Placing Price”) will be decided at the close of the Bookbuild. The book will open with immediate effect following this Announcement. The timing of the closing of the book, pricing and allocations are at the discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and SEGRO. Details of the Placing Price, the number of Placing Shares and the number of Retail Offer Shares will be announced as soon as practicable after the close of the Bookbuild. 
The Placing Shares, if issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue. 
Application will be made for the Placing Shares to be admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List (the ”Official List”) of the Financial Conduct Authority (the ”FCA”), to be admitted to trading on the main market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange plc (the ”London Stock Exchange”) and to be admitted to listing and trading on Euronext in Paris, France (”Euronext Paris”) (together, ”Admission”). Settlement for the Placing Shares and Admission is expected to take place on or before 8.00 a.m. (London time) / 9.00 a.m. (Paris time) on 1 March 2024. The Placing is conditional, among other things, upon Admission becoming effective and the placing agreement between the Company and the Banks (the ”Placing Agreement”) not being terminated in accordance with its terms. The Appendix sets out further information relating to the Bookbuild and the terms and conditions of the Placing. 
The Retail Offer will be made on the terms outlined in a separate announcement to be made shortly regarding the Retail Offer and its terms. 
This Announcement should be read in its entirety. In particular, you should read and understand the information provided in the ”Important notices” section of this Announcement. Investors who have chosen to participate in the Placing, by making an oral or written offer to acquire Placing Shares, will be deemed to have read and understood this Announcement in its entirety and to be making such offer on the terms and subject to the conditions herein, and to be providing the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgements and undertakings contained in the terms and conditions in this Announcement.

Details of the Placing Agreement and the Placing Shares

Following the execution of a terms of placing setting out, among other things, the final number of Placing Shares and the final Placing Price (as defined below) following completion of the Bookbuild (as defined below) (the ”Terms of Placing”), if any such Placee defaults in paying the Placing Price in respect of any Placing Shares allotted to it, the Joint Bookrunners have severally (and not jointly or jointly and severally) agreed to subscribe for such shares, and the Company has agreed to allot or issue, as applicable, such shares to the Settlement Agent, as nominee for the Joint Bookrunners, at the Placing Price, on and subject to the terms set out in the Placing Agreement. 
The Placing Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 10 pence each in the capital of the Company (”Ordinary Shares”), including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue, and will on issue be free of all claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and equities.

It is expected that Admission will become effective at or around 8:00 a.m. (London time) / 9.00 a.m. (Paris time) on 1 March 2024 (or such later time and/or date as the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) may agree with the Company) and that dealings in the Placing Shares will commence at that time. 
The Banks are not acting for the Company with respect to the Retail Offer. 
Bookbuild 
The Joint Bookrunners will today commence the bookbuilding process in respect of the Placing (the ”Bookbuild”) to determine demand for participation in the Placing by Placees. This Appendix gives details of the terms and conditions of, and the mechanics of participation in, the Placing. No commissions will be paid to Placees or by Placees in respect of any Placing Shares. Members of the public are not entitled to participate in the Placing. 
The Banks and the Company shall be entitled to effect the Placing by such alternative method to the Bookbuild as they may, in their sole discretion, determine. 
Participation in, and principal terms of, the Placing 
Conditions of the Placing 
The Placing is conditional upon the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms. The Banks’ obligations under the Placing Agreement are conditional on customary terms and conditions, including among others: 
If: (i) any of the conditions contained in the Placing Agreement, including those described above, are not fulfilled or (where applicable) waived by the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) by the respective time or date where specified (or such later time or date as the Company and the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) may agree); or (ii) the Placing Agreement is terminated in the circumstances specified below under ”Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement”, the Placing will lapse and the Placees’ rights and obligations hereunder in relation to the Placing Shares shall cease and terminate at such time and each Placee agrees that no claim can be made by it in respect thereof. 
The Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) may, in their sole discretion and upon such terms as they think fit, waive compliance by the Company with the whole or any part of any of the Company’s obligations in relation to the conditions contained in the Placing Agreement save that conditions b), d) and e) above may not be waived. Any such extension or waiver will not affect Placees’ commitments as set out in this Announcement. 
By participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that none of the Banks, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision it may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Placing nor for any decision they may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the Placing generally, and by participating in the Placing each Placee agrees that any such decision is within the absolute discretion of the Banks. 
By participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations hereunder terminate only in the circumstances described above and under ”Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement” below, and will not be capable of rescission or termination by the Placee. 
Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement 
The Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) are entitled, by notice to the Company given at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, to terminate the Placing Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Placing Agreement in certain circumstances, including: (i) a breach of the representation, warranties and undertakings of the Company contained in the Placing Agreement which the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) consider to be material in the context of the Group taken as a whole, Placing and/or Admission; or (ii) upon the occurrence of certain material adverse changes in the financial condition or prospects of the Group taken as a whole or in the relevant financial markets or in the event of a force majeure event. 
Upon termination of the Placing Agreement, the parties to the Placing Agreement shall be released and discharged (except for any liability arising before or in relation to such termination) from their respective obligations under or pursuant to the Placing Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. 
By participating in the Placing, Placees agree that the exercise by any Bookrunner of any right of termination or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of such Bookrunner and that neither the Company nor the Banks need make any reference to, or consult with, Placees and neither the Company nor the Banks shall have any liability to Placees whatsoever in connection with any such exercise and none of the Company or the Banks, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates, nor any person acting on any of their respective behalfs, shall have any liability to Placees whatsoever in connection with any such exercise or failure to exercise. 
Lock-up 
The Company has undertaken to the Banks that, between the date of the Placing Agreement and the date which is 180 days after the Closing Date, other than in respect of, amongst other things, grants or exercises of options or share issues pursuant to terms of existing employee share schemes or the Company’s scrip dividend scheme, and the Placing Shares and Retail Offer Shares, it will not, without the prior written consent of the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), directly or indirectly offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Ordinary Shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Ordinary Shares or other investments representing interests in Ordinary Shares or enter into any swap or other agreement or transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of shares, whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise. 
By participating in the Placing, Placees agree that the exercise by the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) of any power to grant consent to the undertaking by the Company of a transaction which would otherwise be subject to the lock-up under the Placing Agreement shall, subject to the terms of the Placing Agreement, be within the discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and that they need not make any reference to, or consultation with, Placees and that they shall have no liability to Placees whatsoever in connection with any such exercise of the power to grant consent or failure to exercise such power. 
No Prospectus 
No offering document or prospectus has been or will be submitted to be approved by the FCA or the French Autorité des marchés financiers (”AMF”) (or any other authority) in relation to the Placing or Admission and no such prospectus is required (in accordance with the Prospectus Regulations) to be published, or will be published. 
Placees’ commitments will be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this Announcement. Each Placee, by accepting a participation in the Placing, agrees that the content of this Announcement (including this Appendix) and all other publicly available information previously or simultaneously published by the Company by notification to a Regulatory Information Service or otherwise filed by the Company is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and confirms that it has neither received nor relied on any other information, representation, warranty, or statement made by or on behalf of the Company or the Banks or any other person and none of the Banks or the Company, nor any other person, will be liable for any Placee’s decision to participate in the Placing based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement which the Placees may have obtained or received (regardless of whether or not such information, representation, warranty or statement was given or made by or on behalf of any such persons). Each Placee acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company in accepting a participation in the Placing. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude the liability of any person for fraudulent misrepresentation. 
Registration and Settlement 
Settlement of transactions in the Placing Shares (ISIN: GB00B5ZN1N88) following Admission will take place within the CREST system, subject to certain exceptions. The Joint Bookrunners and the Company reserve the right to require settlement for, and delivery of, the Placing Shares to Placees by such other means that they deem necessary if delivery or settlement is not practicable within the CREST system within the timetable set out in this Announcement or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in the Placee’s jurisdiction. In particular, in the event of any difficulties or delays in the admission of the Placing Shares to CREST or the use of CREST in relation to the Placing, the Company and the Joint Bookrunners may agree that the Placing Shares should be issued in certificated form. 
Following the close of the Bookbuild, each Placee allocated Placing Shares in the Placing will be sent a trade confirmation in accordance with the standing arrangements it has in place with the relevant Bookrunner stating the number of Placing Shares allocated to it at the Placing Price, the aggregate amount owed by such Placee to the relevant Bookrunner and settlement instructions. Each Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed in accordance with the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions in respect of the Placing Shares that it has in place with the relevant Bookrunner (unless otherwise agreed). 
It is expected that settlement will be on 1 March 2024 in accordance with the instructions set out in the trade confirmation. 
Interest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above at the rate of four percentage points above the Bank of England’s base rate from time to time as determined by the Joint Bookrunners. 
Each Placee is deemed to agree that, if it does not comply with these obligations, the Joint Bookrunners may sell any or all of the Placing Shares allocated to that Placee on such Placee’s behalf and retain from the proceeds, for the Joint Bookrunners’ account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate amount owed by it and may be required to bear any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax or other stamp, securities, transfer, registration, execution, documentary or other similar impost, duty or tax imposed in any jurisdiction (together with any interest, fines or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of such Placing Shares on such Placee’s behalf. By communicating a bid for Placing Shares, each Placee confers on the Joint Bookrunners all such authorities and powers necessary to carry out any such sale and agrees to ratify and confirm all actions which the Joint Bookrunners lawfully take in pursuance of such sale. 
If Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees should ensure that the trade confirmation is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation. 
Insofar as Placing Shares are registered in a Placee’s name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such Placing Shares should, except as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. If there are any circumstances in which any other stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (and/or any interest, fines or penalties relating thereto) is payable in respect of the allocation, allotment, issue or delivery of the Placing Shares (or for the avoidance of doubt if any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable in connection with any subsequent transfer of or agreement to transfer Placing Shares), neither the Company nor the Banks shall be responsible for the payment thereof. 
Representations, Warranties and Further Terms 
By participating in the Placing each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee’s behalf) irrevocably acknowledges, confirms, undertakes, represents, warrants and agrees (for itself and for any such prospective Placee) with the Banks and the Company, in each case as a term of its application for Placing Shares, the following: 
35. that it will acquire any Placing Shares purchased by it for its account or for one or more accounts as to each of which it exercises sole investment discretion and it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such account; 
36. it understands that the Placing Shares are expected to be issued to it through CREST; 
37. where it is acquiring the Placing Shares for one or more managed accounts, that it is authorised in writing by each managed account to acquire the Placing Shares for each managed account and it has full power to make the acknowledgements, representations and agreements herein on behalf of each such account; 
38. if it is a pension fund or investment company, that its purchase of Placing Shares is in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 
39. that it understands and acknowledges that the Company, the Banks and their respective affiliates and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the representations, warranties and acknowledgements set forth herein and in this Announcement; 
40. that it acknowledges and agrees that the exercise by the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) of any power to grant consent to the Company to undertake a transaction which would otherwise be subject to the lock-up under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) (subject to having agreed with the Company not to withhold or delay its consent unreasonably) and that the Joint Bookrunners need not make any reference to, or consult with, it and that the Joint Bookrunners shall have no liability to it in connection with any such exercise of the power to grant such consent; 
41. that it acknowledges and agrees that the good faith exercise or non-exercise by the Joint Bookrunners (on behalf of the Banks) of any right of termination under the placing agreement shall be at the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners, with no requirement to reference or consult with it and the Joint Bookrunners shall have no liability to it in connection with the good faith exercise or non-exercise of such termination right; and 
42. that it acknowledges and agrees that any agreements entered into by it pursuant to the terms and conditions set out in this Announcement, and all non-contractual or other obligations arising out of or in connection with them, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and it submits (on behalf of itself and on behalf of any person on whose behalf it is acting) to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts as regards any claim, dispute or matter arising out of any such contract (including any dispute regarding the existence, validity or termination of such contract or relating to any non-contractual or other obligation arising out of or in connection with such contract), except that enforcement proceedings in respect of the obligation to make payment for the Placing Shares (together with any interest chargeable thereon) may be taken by either the Company or the Joint Bookrunners (at their sole discretion) in any jurisdiction in which the relevant Placee is incorporated. 
The agreement to settle a Placee’s acquisition of Placing Shares (and/or the acquisition by a person for whom such Placee is contracting as agent) free of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax is conditional on the settlement relating only to a subscription by such Placee and/or such person direct from the Company for the Placing Shares in question. Such agreement is also conditional on the Placing Shares not being subscribed for in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to issue or transfer the Placing Shares into a clearance service. If there are any such arrangements, or the settlement relates to any other dealing in the Placing Shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax or other similar taxes (including any interest, fines or penalties) may be payable, for which neither the Company nor the Joint Bookrunners will be liable and the Placees shall indemnify the Company and the Joint Bookrunners on an after-tax basis for any such taxes paid by the Company or the Joint Bookrunners in respect of any such arrangements or dealings. If there are any such arrangements or dealings, each Placee should seek its own advice and notify the Joint Bookrunners accordingly. 
In addition, Placees should note that they will be liable for any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax and all other stamp, issue, securities, transfer, registration, documentary or other duties or taxes (including any interest, fines or penalties) payable outside the UK by them or any other person on the acquisition of any Placing Shares or the agreement to acquire any Placing Shares. 
Each Placee, and any person acting on behalf of the Placee, acknowledges that the Banks do not owe any fiduciary or other duties to any Placee in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings or indemnities in the Placing Agreement. 
Each Placee and any person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges and agrees that any Bookrunner or any of its affiliates may, at its absolute discretion, agree to become a Placee in respect of some or all of the Placing Shares. 
Each Placee and any person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges and agrees that it has neither received nor relied on any inside information concerning the Company in accepting this invitation to participate in the Placing. 
Each Placee undertakes that the person whom it specifies for registration as holder of the Placing Shares will be: (a) itself; or (b) its nominee, as the case may be. None of the Banks or the Company will be responsible for any liability to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax or other similar taxes resulting from a failure to observe this requirement (”Indemnified Taxes”). 
Each Placee agrees to indemnify on an after-tax basis and hold the Company, the Banks and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates harmless from any and all costs, claims, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with any breach of the representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings in this Appendix (including in respect of any Indemnified Taxes) and further agrees that the provisions of this Appendix shall survive after completion of the Placing. 
When a Placee or person acting on behalf of the Placee is dealing with a Bookrunner, any money held in an account with such Bookrunner on behalf of the Placee and/or any person acting on behalf of the Placee will not be treated as client money within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the FCA made under the FSMA. The Placee acknowledges that the money will not be subject to the protections conferred by the client money rules; as a consequence, this money will not be segregated from such Bookrunner’s money in accordance with the client money rules and will be used by such Bookrunner in the course of its own business and the Placee will rank only as a general creditor of such Bookrunner. 
The foregoing representations, warranties, confirmations, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings are given for the benefit of the Company as well as the Banks and are irrevocable. 
The rights and remedies of the Banks and the Company under these terms and conditions are in addition to any rights and remedies which would otherwise be available to each of them and the exercise or partial exercise of one will not prevent the exercise of others. 
Past performance is no guide for future performance and persons reading this Announcement should consult an independent financial adviser. 
All times and dates in this Announcement may be subject to amendment. The Banks shall notify the Placees and any person acting on behalf of the Placees of any changes. 
The information contained herein is not for publication, release or distribution, directly or indirectly, in or into the United States. This Announcement does not contain or constitute an offer for sale or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities in the United States.

2024-02-27 17:18:21,"JEFF BEZOS-BACKED REAL ESTATE COMPANY TARGETS UNEXPECTED MARKETS, FUELING DEBATE ON INVESTMENT IMPACT"," While cities like Miami, Austin and Atlanta have been in the spotlight for real estate investors, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform Arrived is quietly making significant strides in markets that had previously flown under the radar. The real estate investment platform, known for allowing retail investors to buy into properties with as little as $100, is diversifying its portfolio across various U.S. cities, raising concerns about its impact on the housing market. 
Arrived’s Market Focus: Arrived has funded over 360 properties since its launch, with more than $128 million in total property value. In the past six months alone, the platform has funded 76 properties, with a noticeable concentration in markets such as Augusta, GA, Savannah, GA, and Knoxville, TN. These areas, characterized by lower average hourly wages compared to the national average, are becoming hotspots for Arrived’s investments. 
The states with the most properties include Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina, further indicating Arrived’s strategy of targeting markets that might not be on every investor’s radar but offer potential for growth and returns. 
This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. 
The Debate Intensifies: The move has reignited the debate over the role of institutional investors in the housing market. Critics argue that the influx of capital from companies like Arrived drives up property prices and rents, making homeownership and affordable housing increasingly out of reach for locals. Proponents, however, see this as an opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios and for homeowners to tap into a new source of capital. 
U.S. Rep Ro Khanna (D-California) recently criticized the consolidation of single-family homes by investment companies like Arrived, arguing that housing should be a right, not a speculative commodity. His proposed Stop Wall Street Landlords Act aims to curb the role of institutional investors in the housing market. 
Arrived Co-founder Alejandro Chouza responded, emphasizing that Arrived was created to make property ownership accessible to everyone, not just billionaires. 
Arrived’s Growing Influence: With over $128 million in total property value funded, Arrived is not just a minor player. The platform’s recent performance, including paying out more than $972,000 in dividend income in Q4 2023, demonstrates its growing influence in the real estate market. 
The investment platform was the first to be qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell shares of single-family rental properties to non-accredited investors. This model caught the attention of several notable backers early on. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, Zillow Inc. co-founder Spencer Rascoff, Salesforce Inc. CEO Marc Benioff and Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi all invested in Arrived’s $25 million seed round in 2021. Bezos later made a second investment in the company’s Series A round in 2022. 
Arrived is continuing to pioneer new ways for individuals to invest in real estate. The launch of the Arrived Single Family Residential Fund and the introduction of monthly dividends through the Arrived Wallet are making real estate investments even more accessible and flexible. 
As Arrived continues to expand its footprint, the conversation around institutional investment in real estate is sure to evolve. Whether seen as a boon or a bane, the impact of platforms like Arrived on local housing markets is a topic that warrants close attention in the coming years.

2024-02-27 17:18:31,MN: Tomori and Kalulu complete entire training session ahead of Lazio match,"By: Euan Burns

AC Milan defensive duo Fikayo Tomori and Pierre Kalulu both managed to complete
the full training session at Milanello on Tuesday which increases their chances
of facing Lazio on Friday.

As reported by Milan News, the two defenders who have missed the bulk of the
season will soon be available to Stefano Pioli which should make his job a lot
easier.

It has been known that both players should be back very soon and they have been
ramping up their involvement with the rest of the players.

Pierre Kalulu was in the squad for the match against Atalanta but was not
expected to get any minutes, which is what transpired.

He is certainly expected to be in the squad for Friday’s match against Lazio,
but he could now be joined by Tomori.

It would be a surprise for Pioli to name either of them in the starting lineup
as they are going to need to slowly build their match fitness, and facing a
talented side like Lazio would not be a simple return.

Tomori is viewed as Milan’s most important defender but he has been out of
action since the match against Salernitana in December where he pulled up with
the injury.

2024-02-27 17:26:39,FASHION GIANT SHEIN CONSIDERS LONDON STOCK MARKET LISTING," Chinese fashion giant Shein is considering launching a blockbuster stock market listing in London. 
The move would be a major boost for the beleaguered London Stock Exchange after a dearth of new floats and other firms moving their focus towards New York. 
The fast fashion firm has reportedly looked towards a UK listing amid concerns over onerous regulations in the US, according to reports from Bloomberg. 
However, it is understood no final decision has been made and it could still opt for New York. 
But the company is reportedly expecting the US Securities and Exchange Commission could ultimately block an IPO (initial public offering) in the country. 
Shein has been contacted for comment. 
Sky News also reported that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt met Shein chairman Donald Tang in an effort to persuade the firm to list in London. 
Last year, Shein filed initial documents to list in New York, working with advisers from Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. 
AJ Bell head of financial analysis, Danni Hewson, said: “Public listing will put a spotlight on its supply chain and the ethical and environmental issues that surround fast fashion generally. 
“The clothing retailer has come under pressure from lawmakers to prove it does not use forced labour in the manufacture of its products. 
“It has also been accused of copyright infringement, which presents another risk to investors.”"

UFCW Canada
TORONTO, Feb.  27, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Canada has elected a new national president. Shawn Haggerty, a well-known long-time labour activist, has been elected the national president of Canada’s leading and most progressive private sector union, with more than 250,000 members across Canada. In addition, Haggerty has been elected executive vice president of UFCW International, as part of the senior leadership team of a union of 1.3 million members in the U.S. and Canada.
Haggerty’s activism in the labour movement spans decades, when he first became a member of UFCW Local 416P while working as an electrician in the maintenance department at Robin Hood Multi-Foods in Port Colborne, Ontario.
In 2007, Haggerty was elected president of UFCW 175, which is the largest local union in Canada, a role which he remained in for 17 years. He became a UFCW Canada national council vice president in 2007, and in 2019, he was elected UFCW International vice president.
“Shawn has spent his lifetime committed to building a better life for workers, and his decades of experience of a union leader and labour activist makes him the right person to fight the battles modern labour is facing,” says UFCW International President Marc Perrone. “On behalf of UFCW International, we congratulate Shawn, and look forward to working with him to continue improving the lives of our members across North America.”
“I am honoured by the confidence of UFCW Canada and UFCW International in entrusting me in this role,” says President Haggerty. “I have dedicated my career to building a better life for UFCW workers and commit to building upon the excellent work that UFCW activists have achieved over the years. Together, our union family will continue to advance fairness, equality and social justice for our members and all workers.”
Haggerty’s election follows the retirement announcement of the previous UFCW Canada national president, Paul Meinema, who retired after over four decades of dedicated service to the labour movement.
In addition to his new responsibilities as national president of UFCW Canada, Haggerty sits as a trustee on several benefit plan boards, and he also serves as UFCW’s leading voice on the Canadian Labour Congress’s executive council."

2024-02-27 17:25:09,"MACY’S EARNINGS BEAT THE STREET’S LOW EXPECTATIONS, RETAILER PLANS TO CLOSE 150 STORES BY 2026"," Macy’s (M) reported another quarter of dropping sales as a new CEO looks to engineer a comeback. 
The company on Tuesday posted revenue and earnings that were better than the low expectations Wall Street had set for the 165-year-old retailer, which recently rejected a $5.8 billion buyout offer from one of its shareholders, Arkhouse, and its partner Brigade Capital Management. 
In the fourth quarter, Macy’s revenue declined 1.7% year over year to $8.12 billion, slightly above estimates of $8.11 billion. Its digital sales decreased by 4%, while same-store sales were down 5.4%. 
The retailer clocked $685 million in net income, above the expected $554 million, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45 beat the expected $1.99. 
At its namesake Macy’s chain, same-store sales dropped 6% as consumers pulled back on discretionary goods like women’s shoes and cold-weather apparel. But they continued spending on beauty products like fragrances and cosmetics. 
The core of Macy’s customers is ”more of the middle income consumer,” which has a household income of $75,000 or under, CEO Tony Spring told Yahoo Finance over the phone. 
”They’ve been under pressure... the cost of many discretionary items has squeezed their ability to purchase some of the non discretionary items,” said Spring. 
Sales at the company’s luxury chain Bloomingdale’s decreased 1.5%, dragged down by softness in men’s lines and designer handbags. Its cosmetics chain Bluemercury was a small bright spot, growing its sales by 2.3%. 
Spring said these businesses ”cater to a more affluent customer,” with most of the shoppers having a household income of more than $121,000 per year. He said while these consumers aren’t pressured, they are cautious. 
”It’s not a question of whether they can spend, it’s a question of whether they feel it’s the right time to extend themselves,” he said. 
For the full fiscal year 2023, Macy’s revenue declined to $23.1 billion, 5.5% lower compared with 2022. Same-store sales were down 6.9%, as digital and in-store sales dropped 7% and 5%, respectively. 
Macy’s stock jumped more than 4% by midday Tuesday. The original proposal made by Arkhouse on Dec. 1 would see the company go private for $21.00 per share, a 32% premium to Macy’s share price at the time. 
Meanwhile, Arkhouse Management is not giving up without a fight, having nominated nine candidates for Macy’s board of directors last week in a proxy battle. Now Spring, who only took the helm at Macy’s three weeks ago, unveiled the company’s growth strategy for 2025 and beyond. 
Spring, who joined Bloomingdale’s in 1987 and became its CEO in 2014, is dubbing the new strategy ”A Bold New Chapter.” The plan is ”designed to create a more modern Macy’s, Inc. that is expected to generate meaningful value for our shareholders in the years ahead,” he said in Tuesday’s release. 
As part of the initiative, Macy’s is closing 150 underperforming locations, including 50 by year-end. The company did not disclose where these stores are. 
It plans to focus its resources on improving existing stores and product assortment, and investing in digital sales, along with an expansion of small-format stores. 
It also plans to open 15 Bloomingdale’s and 30 Bluemecury stores in the next three years, and to remodel 30 existing Bluemercury locations. 
To better compete with retail behemoths like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), Macy’s is aiming to ”rationalize and monetize” its supply chain, streamline fulfillment, and offer a ”scalable” tech platform in the next three years. 
”I think the fact that we are focused on the customer, that we are focused on our colleagues, that we are making sure that we have the right content, and we are unlocking real estate value and we are increasing our dividends... that’s what creates a much more compelling story about Macy’s Inc.,” Spring said. 
Here are Macy’s Q4 results versus estimates, according to Bloomberg data.

TORONTO,  27 févr. 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Les Travailleurs et travailleuses unis de l’alimentation et du commerce (TUAC) Canada ont élu un nouveau président national. Shawn Haggerty, militant syndical de longue date bien connu, a été élu président national du syndicat le plus important et le plus progressiste du secteur privé au Canada, qui compte plus de 250 000 membres dans tout le pays. En outre, M. Haggerty a été élu vice-président exécutif de l’Union internationale des TUAC, au sein de l’équipe de direction d’un syndicat qui compte 1,3 million de membres aux États-Unis et au Canada.
Le militantisme de M. Haggerty au sein du mouvement syndical remonte à plusieurs décennies. Il est devenu membre de la section locale 416P des TUAC alors qu’il travaillait comme électricien dans le service de maintenance de Robin Hood Multi-Foods à Port Colborne, en Ontario.
En 2007, M. Haggerty a été élu président de la section locale 175 des TUAC, qui est la plus grande section locale au Canada, un rôle qu’il a conservé pendant 17 ans. Il est devenu vice-président du Conseil national des TUAC Canada en 2007 et, en 2019, il a été élu vice-président international des TUAC.
« Shawn a passé sa vie à construire une vie meilleure pour les travailleurs et travailleuses, et ses décennies d’expérience en tant que dirigeant syndical et militant syndical font de lui la personne idéale pour mener à bien les batailles auxquelles le monde du travail moderne est confronté », a déclaré Marc Perrone, président international des TUAC. « Au nom de l’Union internationale des TUAC, nous félicitons Shawn et nous nous réjouissons de travailler avec lui pour continuer à améliorer la vie de nos membres dans toute l’Amérique du Nord. »
« Je suis honoré de la confiance que me témoignent les TUAC Canada et les l’Union internationale des TUAC en me confiant ce rôle », déclare le président Haggerty. « J’ai consacré ma carrière à bâtir une vie meilleure pour les travailleur(euse)s des TUAC et je m’engage à poursuivre l’excellent travail que les militant(e)s des TUAC ont accompli au fil des ans. Ensemble, notre famille syndicale continuera à faire progresser l’équité, l’égalité et la justice sociale pour nos membres et tous et toutes les travailleur(euse)s. »
L’élection de M. Haggerty fait suite à l’annonce du départ à la retraite du précédent président national des TUAC Canada, Paul Meinema, qui a pris sa retraite après plus de quatre décennies de service dévoué au mouvement syndical.
En plus de ses nouvelles responsabilités en tant que président national des TUAC Canada, M. Haggerty siège en tant qu’administrateur à plusieurs conseils d’administration de régimes d’avantages sociaux, et il est également la principale voix des TUAC au sein du conseil exécutif du Congrès du travail du Canada."
