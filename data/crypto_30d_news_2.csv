2024-05-03 15:27:28,"Bitcoin bounces back after soft jobs report, crossing $60K threshold","Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rebounded Friday after a soft U.S. jobs report alleviated worries about higher-for-longer interest rates. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap ( BTC-USD ) jumped 4% to $61.7K at 3:27 p.m. ET, compared with the $59.1K mark it changed hands at just minutes before the April nonfarms payroll report arrived. The U.S. economy added 175K jobs in April , less than the 243K expected and a slower pace than the 315K notched in March (revised from 303K), according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The latest tally marks the smallest payroll growth of 2024, with the largest being 315K in March. Wage growth also cooled last month, potentially giving the Federal Reserve the confidence to ease rates later this year. Ether ( ETH-USD ), the world's largest altcoin, too, saw buying pressure on the back of the cooler-than-expected jobs data, advancing 2.2% to $3.06K at the time of writing. Note the crypto-price gains coincided with a strong stock-market rally, with all three major U.S. indices rising at least 1%. ""It's intriguing to note that Bitcoin rose by 5% following the NFP miss,"" Althea Spinozzi, head of Fixed Income Strategy at Saxo, said in an X post. ""Clearly, the data weren’t weak enough to trigger a broad selloff in risky assets; instead, they had the opposite effect.

2024-05-03 15:24:23,Bitcoin falls 3.2% on a weekly basis as Fed keeps interest rate unchanged,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to post a weekly fall of 3.2% , in a week that saw the Federal Reserve strike a surprisingly more dovish tone while leaving rates unchanged. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) started the month on a disappointing note, as it fell to its lowest level seen in more than two months, and slid to $56.6K, before the Fed's decision came in on Wednesday. BTC, however, pared its losses on the day and rose back to the $58K mark, after the Fed decided to ease its quantitative tightening by slowing the pace of its balance sheet runoff, and held the rates steady for its sixth consecutive meeting. Chair Jerome Powell also ruled out rate hikes as the next likely move. The cryptocurrency has been steady since then, and stayed near the $58K mark. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price has rebounded after the Federal Reserve tapered its QT program, which will serve to boost liquidity in the markets, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin digital financial services firm, Cory Klippsten said. ""BTC is sitting above $60,000 and large capital allocators haven’t even arrived to the party yet. This, along the Fed returning to more accommodative policies, has investors bullish on Bitcoin’s future prospects,"" Klippsten added. The largest cryptocurrency has also been witnessing a sell-off, while the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ((ETFs)) have seen outflows. Retail investors selling off cryptocurrencies alongside other headwinds is keeping J.P. Morgan cautious toward the market . On Thursday, U.S. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs witnessed its largest daily outflow since last August, as investors pulled $564M from 11 Bitcoin ETFs, the biggest pullout since the ETFs debuted in January. ""BTC-USD has shown a negative reaction following the recent halving event, contrary to historical trends,"" said SA analyst Income Generator, adding he expects BTC's short term trend to be downward, but long-term is more favorable. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has dropped ~9% since the halving event took place on April 20. ""Most of the evidence appears to be centered in the positive direction, and this means that recent declines in BTC-USD could unveil new buying opportunities relatively soon,"" Income Generator added. Another SA analyst, Knox Ridley , also remained optimistic and said, ""Both technical and on-chain analysis support higher levels for Bitcoin, and as long as any further weakness holds $42,750, we view this dip as a buying opportunity.""

2024-05-03 10:23:16,"Bonds are in an early secular bear market, stocks in a late secular bull market - analyst","BofA Strategist Michael Hartnett said that bonds are in an “early secular bear market” that is driven by inflation. This is due to “fiscal excess, debt, war, deglobalization,” he wrote in a BofA “The Flow Show” report. The 30-year U.S. Treasury ( US30Y ) was down 40% during the past four years. The secular bear “is only over once electorates on Main St. (via elections) and Wall St. (via debt ratings, and failed auctions) vote for less fiscal excess,” he said. ( TBT ) ( TLT ) ( SHY ) ( IEI ) ( IEF ) Commodities, however, are in an “early secular bull market.” Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) has outperformed stocks ( SP500 ), ( COMP:IND ), ( DJI ) since the U.S-China trade war began in 2018. ( GLD ) ( USO ) ( PDBC ) Stocks, on the other hand, are “in late secular bull market” with no change in U.S. leadership -- namely, top tech stocks -- since 2019, and no recession to change leadership plus valuation, Hartnett said. ( SPY ) ( IVV ) ( VOO ) ( IWM ) ( IWR ) ( MDY ) According to him, this would end with a bubble and/or with a recession. Lastly, he said the U.S. dollar, is in a “secular bear market,” especially compared to cryptocurrencies ( BTC-USD ), ( ETH-USD ), ( BNB-USD ) and gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ). “U.S. debt/deficits require weaker FX to attract foreign capital and/or Fed support for Treasury via rate cuts,” he said, adding that the U.S. dollar cyclical bull on U.S. exceptionalism is driven by “exceptionally easy fiscal policy.” More on United States 30-Year Bond Yield: Weekly Forecast, April 19, 2024: Higher For 30 Years?

Daily Bitcoin production in April remained the same as the prior month, despite the Bitcoin halving occurring on 19 April 2024.

Morgan cautious on crypto with retreat by retail investors, dearth of upside drivers","Retail investors selling off cryptocurrencies alongside other headwinds is keeping J.P. Morgan cautious toward the market. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) finished sharply lower in April, sinking 15% for the first monthly loss since August 2023. It traded close to $59,000 on Thursday, much lower than its all-time high above $73,000 in March. “The past two weeks saw significant selling/profit taking with perhaps retail investors playing a bigger role than institutional investors,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Thursday note. Spot bitcoin ETFs logged outflows in April and retail investors appeared to have sold both crypto and equity assets during last month’s trade, the firm said. Panigirtzoglou also said the market is facing a trio of headwinds consisting of elevated positioning, high bitcoin prices compared with gold as well as estimated bitcoin production costs, and subdued crypto funding by venture capitalists. “In all, with a lack of positive catalysts, with the retail impulse dissipating and with the three headwinds mentioned … still in place, we maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets over the near term,” Panigirtzoglou said. In terms of institutional investors, J.P. Morgan said it’s mostly momentum traders such as Commodity Trading Advisors or other quantitative funds taking profit on previous extreme long positions in bitcoin as well as in gold.

The consensus EPS Estimate is $1.05 and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $1.34B (+73.5% Y/Y). ""Bitcoin hit a new all-time high, and Ethereum implemented its largest upgrade in over a year; as such, Coinbase earnings, as a key beneficiary of the activity, will likely to step up significantly this quarter,"" said J.P. Morgan Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices jumped 61% in the first quarter of the year as it benefited from the SEC's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products . The cryptocurrency was boosted by the trading frenzy among the U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. ""The stock has recently bounced back, driven by renewed interest in cryptocurrencies and regulatory approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded funds,"" said SA analyst Yiannis Zourmpanos . ""Investors should understand that the stock is extremely volatile, but as the crypto-economy expands its reach, I expect crypto assets to become less volatile over time,"" said SA analyst KM Capital . KM Capital also said COIN looks like the company of the future. Last month, Coinbase ( COIN ) said it had filed an appeal in a federal court challenging a key legal point that allowed its case against the U.S. SEC to move forward in March. In a so-called interlocutory appeal, the cryptocurrency exchange asked the court to weigh in on whether the SEC can consider a digital asset transaction as an investment contract, a resolution that would have industry-wide implications. Coinbase ( COIN ), which had reaped benefits during the bull market in 2021, had to contend with challenges in 2022 due to certain external factors, said SA analyst Joseph Parrish. ""Despite the setbacks, Coinbase has managed to flesh out the business and continues to evolve under management's vision,"" Parrish added. Last quarter, COIN returned to profitability for the first time in three years, thanks in part to higher interest income from its stablecoin reserves amid a bull run across crypto assets prices. The upside is potentially huge, but it's also a steep climb that depends on outside forces working out well, Parrish said. ""The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC presents a significant opportunity for Coinbase to generate revenue and expand its market share,"" said SA analyst Noah's Arc Capital Management .

During the quarter, the miner generated 1,364 bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), a decrease of 36% from the 2,115 bitcoin produced during the three months ended March 31, 2023, due primarily to the significant increase in the bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023.

2024-04-30 15:18:09,Binance founder Changpeng Zhao ordered to spend four months in prison,"Another crypto tycoon bites the dust. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao received on Tuesday a prison sentence of four months after admitting guilt to charges tied to enabling money laundering within his crypto exchange. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) extended intraday losses after the news, sliding 5.1% to $59.7K at 3:18 p.m. ET. Sentenced by U.S. District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle federal court, the 47-year-old billionaire's prison sentence was well below the three years that federal prosecutors had sought. The sentencing guidelines recommended a term of 12 to18 months, while CZ's lawyers had requested five months of probation. In November, CZ was said to have pleaded guilty to allegedly violating criminal U.S. anti-money laundering requirements, resolving the U.S. government's years-long probe into Binance. Zhao also stepped down as CEO of his exchange as part of the settlement. In separate litigation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission each sued Binance, accusing it of mishandling customer funds and operating as an unregistered exchange in the U.S. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced last month to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating the large-scale fraud and conspiracy that led to the downfall of his crypto empire. Unlike Bankman-Fried, Zhao was never accused of stealing customer assets.

2024-04-30 12:32:27,MicroStrategy stock dives as investors weigh steep Q1 loss,"Even though bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged nearly 70% in Q1, MicroStrategy turned in a wider-than-expected loss for the three-month period as current accounting rules resulted in a large impairment charge against the value of its bitcoin stash. MSTR dropped 17% in Tuesday afternoon trading, but still remained 70% higher so far this year. The business intelligence company, run by bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) advocate Michael Saylor, did not opt for early adoption of new accounting rules whereby MSTR could recognize any gains in its bitcoin holdings. Instead, it stuck to current requirements and recorded a digital asset impairment loss of $191.6M in Q1, as its bitcoin buying spree continued. However, there were some positives in the report, amid MSTR's transition to a recurring subscription cloud-based revenue model, including 30% annual growth in subscription billings and a 22% Y/Y increase in subscription services revenues. In its Q1 earnings conference call , MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ), the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), highlighted the benefits of accessing capital markets to buy the token as a capital allocation strategy and why its stock warrants a premium to net asset value. ""While the overall market benefited from the increase in Bitcoin price as well, we believe our opportunistic use of leverage and excess cash to acquire Bitcoin, as well as our capital market strategy generated $1.8 billion of incremental shareholder value,"" said President and CEO Phong Le. BTIG analyst Andrew Harte thinks MSTR is a better way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) than alternatives, such as spot bitcoin ETFs, due to: ""1) the company's ability to leverage capital markets to purchase additional bitcoin, 2) cash flow from its BI software business to acquire more bitcoin, 3) derivatives on the stock that provide investors with risk-management opportunities, and 4) ease of access compared to directly purchasing BTC."" ""We have harnessed volatility, and we've also harnessed our unique ability to issue securities such as convertible bonds,"" Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman, said in the call. ""And the fact that we embrace the securitization of Bitcoin and we embrace the volatility of the asset class has given us the ability to raise capital, right?""

2024-04-28 14:21:00,"MicroStrategy stands to flourish if it implements new accounting rules, analyst says","Adopting new accounting standards could be a game changer for MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Benchmark said in a recent note to clients. Such a move could significantly boost the software company’s earnings, giving it a shot at joining the S&P 500. Since the Michael Saylor-founded company started holding bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on its balance sheet in 2020, it has recorded $2.27B in cumulative impairment losses due to a rule by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) called ASC 350, analyst Mark Palmer noted. As of March 19, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) held 214,246 BTC , which, as of Friday afternoon’s price, was worth $13.6B. Under the rule, firms treat crypto as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trademarks, copyrights and other items that rarely change hands. As a result, companies record their crypto at the historical price they paid and review their holdings every quarter for impairments. Holdings are considered impaired even if the price of a crypto falls temporarily during the reporting period, and values can’t be upwardly revised if the price recovers. Last year, though, the FASB floated new accounting rules that will allow companies to record gains and losses immediately and classify crypto assets as financial assets. The new rules take effect on Jan. 1, 2025, but companies have the option to apply them early. In MicroStrategy’s ( MSTR ) case, the earnings impact “would be massive: the company in its 2023 10-K report estimated that early adoption would increase its 2024 beginning retained earnings balance by ~$3.1bn,” Palmer wrote. MSTR is slated to publish its Q1 2024 results on April 29 after market close. Analysts, on average, expect the company to post an adjusted loss per share of $0.13 vs. EPS of $5.62 in the previous quarter and EPS of $30.59 a year before. MSTR’s notable earnings fluctuations coincide with bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price volatility. Palmer thinks MSTR could record a gain of over $300 per share in Q1, should it opt for early adoption of the fair-value accounting rules. “However, we also believe that the tax implications associated with adoption could cause MSTR to hold off on electing that option,” he added. With MSTR’s shares being highly liquid, its market cap exceeding $18B, and 50% of its outstanding shares available for trading, the company meets nearly all the requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, the note said. Another criterion for the S&P Dow Jones’ index committee to consider a stock for S&P 500 inclusion includes the submission of positive earnings in a company’s most recent quarter. But, as Palmer noted, MSTR has reported losses in 10 of the past 14 quarters. However, early adoption of the new accounting rules suggests MSTR could meet that requirement. “Inclusion in the S&P 500 would position MSTR’s stock valuation to receive an ongoing boost from price-agnostic purchases of its own shares resulting from enormous passive inflows,” the note read.

2024-04-26 15:18:48,Bitcoin almost flat a week after halving event,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to marginally rise 0.3% on a weekly basis, as it traded narrowly in the week, after the keenly-awaited halving event took place last Friday. The largest cryptocurrency prices traded in the range of $62K-$67K in the week. BTC fell briefly below $63K on Thursday, as the Q1 GDP came in at an annual rate of 1.6% signalling sticky inflation, which further dented rate cut hopes. BTC however, quickly recovered back to the $63K mark, and held steady throughout the day. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) also remained near $64K today, despite a significant rise in outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of April 25, U.S.-listed ETFs had a daily total net outflows of $217M, according to Market data . The cryptocurrency also held steady after the core PCE price index , the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying inflation, rose in line with consensus in March. “Bitcoin( BTC-USD ) continues to consolidate in the same range it has for the last month after the much-anticipated halving event. There's been a lot of chatter about price implications, but the real story is that Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) programmatic monetary policy marched ahead as scheduled since the day the network started,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of financial service firm, Swan Bitcoin. The start of the week came off the back of the halving event, as Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) went through its fourth halving event last Friday following a quadrennial software update in blockchain, marking a highly anticipated catalyst for BTC. ""Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) annual inflation rate was cut in half, and, in roughly four years it will be cut in half again. No politics were involved, no talk of the current economic backdrop, and no last-second questioning from policymakers. This certainty and predictability stands in stark contrast to the traditional monetary system,” added Klippsten.

The quadrennial halving event is when BTC miners’ reward for validating transactions is slashed in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new tokens are created by 50%. “It's pretty simple: fixed supply, new issuance of bitcoin cut in half, demand and utility rising. Buy Bitcoin regularly, hold with a long-term horizon, and you'll probably be happy you did,”said Brady Swenson, cofounder of Swan, a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) financial services company. The world's oldest digital currency stayed under $70K over the past week, and briefly went below the $60K level on Wednesday for the first time since early March. The dip was reportedly due to an increase in volatility leading up to the halving event. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) also briefly fell below $60K on Friday after r eports of Israel launching a retaliatory strike against Iran, but it quickly regained lost ground. Deutsche Bank said the halving event is already partially priced in by the market. ""Looking ahead, we continue to expect prices to stay high due to expectations of future spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETF approvals; future central bank rate cuts; and regulatory changes."" The research firm also expects the geography of crypto mining to shift after BTC's halving, as the lower block reward compresses margins, forcing miners to seek cheaper and reliable forms of energy. ""Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East have caught the attention of crypto miners due to their lower energy costs."" J.P. Morgan said it does not expect a rise in BTC prices post-halving as the event has already been priced in, and projected a potential downside instead.

2024-04-18 15:10:33,Crypto exchange Kraken buys TradeStation Crypto to boost U.S. presence,"In a bid to expand its regulatory licensing in the U.S., cryptocurrency exchange Kraken said Thursday it's buying TradeStation Crypto, the digital assets unit of TradeStation Group, part of Monex Group ( OTCPK:MNXBF ). The transaction is part of our efforts to accelerate our U.S. presence and will unlock further growth and new product opportunities for Kraken in the U.S,"" a Kraken spokesperson told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement. Though TradeStation's crypto business has secured money transmitter and other types of regulatory licenses in many U.S. states over the last few years, it was slapped with a $1.5M penalty to settle the U.S. Securities and Commission's charges accusing the Florida-based company of failing to register a crypto lending product before offering it to investors. Kraken, too, was charged by the SEC in November 2023 for allegedly commingling customer money with its own while operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.

2024-04-18 14:34:16,Bitcoin halving on deck – here’s what to expect,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a little ways away from undergoing a once-every-four-years software update in the blockchain that has historically been hyped as a positive catalyst for the highest-profile cryptocurrency. The quadrennial halving event, due as soon as Friday, occurs when bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners’ reward for validating transactions is slashed in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new tokens are created by 50%. As such, the technical event reduces the supply of new bitcoins entering the market, a move that could drive up the coin’s price should demand remain constant or rise. And, given the fixed supply of 21M bitcoins ( BTC-USD ), the halving event reinforces scarcity by reducing the rate at which new BTCs are introduced into circulation. If history serves as a guide (that is, the halving has preceded big price gains), the event could boost the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to more than $115K, crypto tax-reporting firm CoinLedger said in a study last month. Since there have only been three halvings so far, it should be taken with a grain of salt that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) tends to rise after the event. SA analyst Florian Grummes had warned that BTC typically weakens for about 15 to 45 days immediately before and after the halving. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had already reached a record high of $73.8K in mid-March, as the green light for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has spurred strong and persistent demand for the token. Now, volatility has spiraled amid the countdown to the halving (as well as jitters about higher-for-longer interest rates), with bitcoin dropping some 17% since hitting its record. H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese is in the camp that the halving will prove to be a positive development for the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). But “the supply shock impact could take months to materialize, and we are now cautious on BTC prices over the short term given geopolitical issues in the Middle East and re-accelerating inflation.” He wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC retreat to the low-to-mid $50K range over the near-term, before rebounding and resuming its longer-term bull run. Should that come to fruition, he added, “there could be some short-term pressure on mining stocks ( MARA ) ( RIOT ) ( HUT )( HIVE )( BTBT )( BITF ) if we were to see such drawdown in BTC prices.” Note that miners’ profitability generally suffers after a halving as their miner reward gets cut in half. This fourth halving will lower the reward to 3.125 BTC from the current 6.25. The overall halving process is expected to end in 2140, when the number of bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) in circulation are expected to reach its programmed cap of 21M. There are currently about 19.7M BTC in circulation. Still, publicly-traded miners “are well positioned to take advantage of the new environment, mainly due to greater access to funding and in particular financing,” J.P. Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Thursday note. “This helps them to scale their operations and invest into more efficient equipment.” Deutsche Bank’s Marion Laboure argued that bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price likely won’t see a significant increase post-halving, as the event “is already partially priced in by the market.” The analyst does expect prices to stay high, though, amid expectations of spot ether ( ETH-USD ) ETF approvals, central bank policy easing and regulatory changes.

In reflecting its broadening focus, the Data division will feature the development and strategic investment in technology, including artificial intelligence and peer-to-peer platforms.

2024-04-12 15:07:29,Bitcoin falls 1.7% week over week amid heightened market volatility,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set to fall marginally by ~1.7% on a weekly basis, amid a sell-off in Wall Street’s major market averages and as volatility levels spiked to their record high of the year. On Friday afternoon, the VIX- known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was up 22.3% . This jump took the volatility index to its highest level since Oct. 31, 2023. The index is now up about 58% from its 52-week low of $11.81 reached in December. The leading cryptocurrency started the week strongly and hit $72K on Monday, a week after it had touched around the $65,000 level. But, BTC retreated below the psychological threshold of $70K on Tuesday over continuing market volatility. BTC prices, however, remained relatively stable on Wednesday and were back to the $70K mark, amid a hotter than expected consumer price index for March, which sent shockwaves across the more traditional markets. ""Although this week has seen a lot of volatility stemming from the US inflation reports and the announcement that the SEC plans to sue Uniswap, the markets have held steady with Bitcoin hovering around $70k,"" said Nick Ruck, COO of ContentFi Labs. ""This could be a sign that the market has not yet peaked and investors are bullish that the industry still has more room to grow,"" added Ruck. Uniswap Labs received a notice from the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating that the SEC plans to recommend a legal action against the company, the firm said in a blog post on Wednesday. Cryptocurrencies are expected to be in the spotlight for some time due to the halving event, which is soon approaching. ""Digital asset investors and traders are asking the question ‘is the halving priced in’ and each cycle it tends to not be. Similarly, many investors thought the BTC ETF approval was also priced in, but over the first 60 days of ETF trading bitcoin price rallied considerably. Why? Because these particular events lead to real changes in supply and demand mechanics on exchange order books,"" said BitGo.

A total of 43.4% of respondents of the American Association of Individual Investors, or AAII, Sentiment survey showed optimism about where the market is headed in the next six months, compared to 47.3% and 50%, respectively in the last two weeks. The percentage of those surveyed who felt bearish about the market also rose this week. It came in at 24%, compared to the 22.2% figure last week. Neutral sentiments also rose this week, with 32.5% of the respondents polled by AAII seeing no change in the market direction. The number was 30.5% the week before. The hotter-than-expected consumer inflation report released this week, which climbed 0.4% in March and exceeded the 0.3% rise that economists expected, dampened hopes of a near-term prospect for a Federal Reserve rate cuts. “Even without a war or any other event that causes a major disruption in global oil supplies, we see no scenario for U.S. inflation in which it is likely that the U.S. Fed would be justified in lowering interest rates, any time between now and October 2024,” pointed out Seeking Alpha analyst James Kostohryz. However, President Joe Biden still sees the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by the end of the year, he said on Wednesday, standing by his prediction laid out last month. Nasdaq, S&P and Dow futures ticked higher on Thursday, following the report. The S&P 500 index ( SP500 ) fell nearly 1% in the last one week, while Dow Jones Industrial Average Index ( DJI ) declined over 1%. NASDAQ Composite Index ( COMP:IND ) fell 0.6%. NASDAQ 100-Index ( NDX ) declined 0.8%. Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) rose 4% since last Thursday, while Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) rose nearly 3%.

2024-04-11 07:36:27,Robinhood stock dips after Citi downgrades to Sell on fundamentals disconnect,"Robinhood Markets ( NASDAQ: HOOD ) stock dropped 3.3% in Thursday premarket trading after Citi downgraded the stock and crypto trading app to Sell, fearing the market may be placing too much weight on the app's crypto business. The stock's 44% year-to-date climb appears to be largely due to rising bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices (up ~64%) even though crypto only accounts for an estimated 13% of Q1 2024 revenue, analyst Christopher Allen said. ""Given the increase in stock price, we believe valuation levels have disconnected from the fundamental outlook,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Robinhood's ( HOOD ) fundamentals, such as trading activity, assets under custody, and deposit growth, have improved in recent periods, he added, allowing Citi to increase its price target on the stock to $16 from $13. ""But we see risks to the stock here on any material pullback in BTC prices (ETF flows have slowed lately, halving event ahead creates some uncertainty), slower retail activity, or market pullback given current valuations,"" Allen said. Citi's Sell rating on the stock contrasts with the SA Quant rating and the average Wall Street rating , both at Hold, and clashes with the average SA Analyst rating of Buy.

2024-04-08 14:58:34,Ripple CEO sees crypto market cap soaring to $5T by year's end - report,"The market value of crypto could nearly double to $5T by the end of the year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said Monday, thanks to persistent demand in recently approved spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded funds as well as the upcoming bitcoin halving event. The overall crypto market cap stood at $2.7T at the time of writing, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Almost three-quarters of that figure represents the combined market value of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). Both tokens have shot up so far this year, with BTC surging 63% YTD, currently inches away from its all-time high reached last month. “I’ve been around this industry for a long time, and I’ve seen these trends come and go,” Garlinghouse told CNBC in an interview. “I’m very optimistic. I think the macro trends, the big-picture things like the ETFs, they’re driving for the first time real institutional money.” The halving, due later this month, ultimately reduces the supply of new bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) entering the market, a move that could drive up the coin’s price should demand remain constant or rise. This will be the first halving in which institutions and retail investors have access to U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, approved on Jan. 10, to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to invest directly in the underlying asset. “That doesn’t take an economics major to tell you what happens when supply contracts and demand expands.” Garlinghouse said , as quoted by CNBC. Also stoking the crypto market this year, the Ripple boss said he is optimistic that crypto regulation in the U.S. will become clearer and more accommodating. “The U.S. is still the largest economy in the world, and it’s unfortunately been one of the more hostile crypto markets. And I think that’s going to start to change, also.” More on Bitcoin USD, Ethereum USD, etc. VanEck's Ethereum Layer-2s Valuation Prediction By 2030 Penthouse To Prison: Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced To 25 Years As Bitcoin Resurges Bitcoin: Potential Correction Despite ETFs And Halving Crypto market heats up ahead of halving event: Bitcoin surpasses $72K again Bitcoin off to a slow start in Q2, falls 2.6% week-on-week"

2024-04-08 06:48:03,Crypto market heats up ahead of halving event: Bitcoin surpasses $72K again,"The rise of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) over the past year stands at a remarkable 157% and nearly 63% so far this year. The leading cryptocurrency reached above $72,000 on Monday; just after a week, it had touched around the $65,000 level. Bitcoin is currently changing hands at about $72,140, with market capitalization rising to about $1.42 trillion. Cryptocurrencies are expected to be in the spotlight for some time due to the halving event, which is soon approaching. After every four years, new token issuance goes down by half during this event. Previously, halving events were associated with bitcoin price gains. Positive momentum isn’t limited to Bitcoin alone; other digital tokens also recorded significant gains. Ether ( ETH-USD ) increased by 6.4% to $3,608, while Cardano ( ADA-USD ) rose 2.44% and Solana ( SOL-USD ) rose by 1%. Even smaller tokens referred to as meme coins registered gains too; Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) jumped up by almost 5%, and Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ) gained around 3.2%. The spike in bitcoin's price has also had an impact on crypto-related stocks.

2024-04-05 15:06:24,"Bitcoin off to a slow start in Q2, falls 2.6% week-on-week","Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) started this month on a weaker note after last month's rally, with the top cryptocurrency set to fall ~2.6% this week. As for the halving event expected in a little over two weeks, some believe current prices may have already factored in the event, while others argue there may still be some upside ahead. ""After hitting and breaking the resistance zone coming from the two major peaks in 2021, BTC stalled and started moving sideways but did not break back below the former resistance level, which is now acting as support. So that is an indication that the market feels quite comfortable here,"" said Julius de Kempenaer, Senior Technical Analyst at StockCharts.com. Kempenaer expects an upward break and a further rally in the next week or two. BTC started the week strongly, as it touched $70K on Monday, but dropped significantly below the mark on Tuesday , after the U.S. manufacturing activity came in hotter than expected. BTC, however, caught a bid on Thursday, on a day when the U.S. stocks closed lower, after some Federal Reserve speakers issued cautious commentary on rate cuts, adding more evidence is needed before interest rate cuts are implemented. ""Historically, BTC halving events have marked significant points followed by 9-18 months of uptrend, culminating in cycle peaks. However, for the first time, BTC reached its all-time high in anticipation of the halving, indicating a departure from previous cycles,"" said Matteo Greco, research analyst at Fineqia International. ""If historical patterns repeat, we may witness an uptrend for the remaining nine months of 2024, leading to a cycle peak expected between Q4 2024 and Q2 2025,"" Greco added.

This is not Amazon in 1994. This is Amazon in 2004.

The survey results came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday repeated the need for more evidence before cutting rates, indicating that a slight possibility of rate cuts later this year. Powell said he doesn't expect ""that it will be appropriate"" to lower the policy rate until ""we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2%."" This has led to Wall Street’s main stock indexes gain on Thursday. However, a recent Seeking Alpha analysis by Michael Kramer pointed out that “rising commodity prices and warning signs indicate that inflation readings in the coming months may not be favorable, reducing the likelihood of rate cuts in 2024.” Separately, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that U.S. services growth slowed in March, with PMI falling to 51.4 versus 52.6 in February.
