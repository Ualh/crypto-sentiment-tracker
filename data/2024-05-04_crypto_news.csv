During a conversation with Pensions & Investments Editor-in-Chief Jennifer Ablan in a LinkedIn Live event, Kashkari said that consumers are investing money in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), “not knowing what their investing in,” and that the cryptocurrency is “so volatile that some people could be put in a lot of harm's way.” He said that Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) hard cap could go down to zero, and compared it to Beanie Babies with “no actual utility in the economy, other than being a nice toy that some people enjoy owning and trading.” He added that the only use cases he has seen are cases where traders are “trying to subvert banking regulations, get around either marijuana banking, or illicit activities.” In addition, he used Amazon ( AMZN ) as a comparison. “The ‘Bitcoin bros’ would say…in 1994 nobody ever bought a book online, so [someone could say] Amazon ( AMZN ) has no future. This is not Amazon in 1994. This is Amazon in 2004. Bitcoin has been around for more than a decade, and more than a decade later, there's still no legitimate use case in an advanced democracy.” More on Bitcoin USD Penthouse To Prison: Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced To 25 Years As Bitcoin Resurges Bitcoin: Potential Correction Despite ETFs And Halving Bitcoin: Flows And Tech Optimism ProShares launches new ETFs offering leveraged and short bitcoin exposure Bitcoin drops 6.4% pulling crypto-related stocks down"
2024-04-04 11:57:32,Bullish sentiment falls amid talks of interest rate cut - AAII,"Optimism among individual investors about the short-term outlook for the stock market has declined this week amid talks of interest rate cut coming to the spotlight again.

The number was 27.6% the week before. The survey results came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday repeated the need for more evidence before cutting rates, indicating that a slight possibility of rate cuts later this year. Powell said he doesn't expect ""that it will be appropriate"" to lower the policy rate until ""we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2%."" This has led to Wall Street’s main stock indexes gain on Thursday. However, a recent Seeking Alpha analysis by Michael Kramer pointed out that “rising commodity prices and warning signs indicate that inflation readings in the coming months may not be favorable, reducing the likelihood of rate cuts in 2024.” Separately, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that U.S. services growth slowed in March, with PMI falling to 51.4 versus 52.6 in February. The S&P 500 index ( SP500 ) fell 0.8% in the last one week, while Dow Jones Industrial Average Index ( DJI ) declined 1.7%. NASDAQ Composite Index ( COMP:IND ) fell 0.6%.

Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), which gained nearly 3% in the last one week, jumped to another record high on Wednesday after Powell's remarks.
