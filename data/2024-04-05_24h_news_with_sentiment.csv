The historic Kashan bazaar in central Iran once sat on a major caravan route, its silk carpets known the world over. But for the weavers trying to get their rugs sold under its ancient arches, their world has only unravelled since the collapse of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers and wider tensions with the West. Rug exports, once exceeding $2 billion two decades ago, have plummeted to less than $50 million in the last Persian year that ended in March, according to government custom figures.

2024-05-04 03:40:44,the $1 trillion power couple reshaping finance,"HODLX GUEST POSTSUBMIT YOUR POST
The DeFi (decentralized finance) market has staged an impressive comeback over
the past 12 months – with the TVL (total value locked) across all protocols 
doubling to $93 billion.

Meanwhile, excitement surrounding the capabilities of generative AI continues to
build.

A Bloomberg report suggests this industry could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032
and “fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates.”

DeFi and AI (artificial intelligence) are set to go from strength to strength in
their respective fields over the coming decade.

But there’s been little discussion about the seismic impact these technologies
can have if applied together – delivering exponential growth and revolutionizing
finance on a global scale.

In the seven years since DeFi protocols came into existence, a blossoming
ecosystem of financial applications and services have been built on top of
blockchain networks, offering a modern, real-time parallel to the outdated and
slow infrastructure relied upon by traditional institutions.

Smart contracts now offer self-executing agreements that eliminate the need for
intermediaries and open up access to lending, borrowing, trading and saving – 
all with much more competitive interest rates.

When you peel away the complicated jargon and talk of liquidity pools and yield
farming, the opportunities that DeFi presents are nothing short of mind-blowing.

In a world where access to banking services is governed by strict eligibility
criteria that billions of people are unable to meet, these protocols can secure
financial inclusion for unbanked and underbanked populations around the world.

Now, anyone can manage their money through a smartphone.

Funds can be sent and received instantly and cheaply without depending on
gatekeepers who charge punishing fees, while those shut out of receiving a
credit score can now build a reputation on the blockchain.

By bringing DeFi and AI together, a multi-trillion-dollar power couple begins to
form with truly transformative use cases.

But what does this look like in practice – and what are the opportunities and
challenges on the horizon as we redefine the future?

DeFi done right

AI’s ability to digest vast datasets in the blink of an eye, make intelligent
predictions and connect the dots between trends is going to supercharge the
world of DeFi.

We’re barely scratching the surface when it comes to the potential applications.

Algorithms powered by AI can analyze market trends, bringing together news
coverage, social media posts, historical data and brand-new figures in the time
it takes a human to get a cup of coffee.

Applied correctly, this allows traders to stay ahead of the curve, enables
businesses to detect changing behaviors and helps forward-thinking entrepreneurs
spot compelling opportunities for new goods and services.

What’s more, all of these in-depth insights can be delivered with full
automation, saving time and boosting productivity.

Together, AI and DeFi will also reinvent the way we interact with money,
personalizing financial services like never before.

Imagine an algorithm that makes bespoke recommendations on the products you’ll
love based on past purchases or uncovers discounts for car rentals and
accommodation when you’re booking flights.

While the barriers to entry surrounding investments and financial planning have
started to come down in recent years, many consumers still lack the means and
the know-how to prepare for a brighter future.

In the coming years, all of that will change, with AI-enriched platforms
enabling investors to save regularly, invest wisely and budget meticulously.

And instead of adopting a ‘one size fits all’ approach, each user would be able
to benefit from specific plans based on their income and outgoings – with
investment portfolios and trading strategies tailored to an individual’s risk
tolerance and long-term goals.

Broadening access to fintech can be done safely as AI and DeFi converge.

Both technologies will also prove invaluable in the fight against identity
fraud, which cost Americans a staggering $23 billion last year.

Advanced analytics, fueled by machine learning, have the power to detect complex
patterns of fraud in multiple locations instantaneously – while the
cryptographic security offered by blockchain platforms helps remove some of the
attack vectors commonly exploited by malicious actors.

This, when coupled with faster and more accurate KYC (know your customer)
checks, can prevent funds from being stolen in the first place, and make DeFi
platforms an even safer environment for storing assets.

A win-win situation for consumers and lenders also starts to emerge, thanks to a
revolution in credit underwriting.

Applications can be scrutinized using alternative data points – enabling
self-employed individuals to access capital rather than suffer arbitrary
rejections – with users building a reputation score on immutable blockchains.

This leads to more informed lending decisions for DeFi platforms and the
development of robust risk management strategies.

Leveraging machine learning, AI can automate the creation and execution of smart
contracts, streamlining operations and eliminating the potential for human
error.

We’re already starting to see innovative new projects take advantage of these
capabilities like Zircuit, a layer-two blockchain with AI-enabled security, and
Ritual, the network for open AI infrastructure.

Innovating responsibly

There’s so much to be excited about – and a lot to be working on. But against
this backdrop of innovation, careful consideration must be paid to the potential
pitfalls of a close integration between AI and DeFi.

Data quality, privacy and security are three crucial themes that innovators need
to focus on as they build new products.

Robust safeguards need to be in place to shield protocols against adversarial
attacks.

The complexities of regulatory compliance are another hurdle to overcome, with
jurisdictions worldwide set to pay closer attention to both technologies in the
years ahead.

There are also ethical implications to reflect on. The purveyors of AI tools
need to ensure they mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias that leads to unjust
outcomes.

State-of-the-art cybersecurity is required to ensure that the personal data
processed by up-and-coming platforms isn’t misused for malicious purposes.

And as AI models are developed, transparency is needed to ensure potential
errors can be remedied – and that the public has confidence in the systems
they’re interacting with.

Let’s not forget that new technology also represents a steep learning curve for
consumers, who can be resistant to change.

DeFi and AI have the potential to redefine finance as we know it.

By democratizing access, promoting inclusion and fostering a more transparent
and secure ecosystem, this technological marriage could usher in a new era of
empowerment for all.

But to truly unlock their potential, we must address future challenges head-on
and ensure these tools are responsibly implemented.

The future of finance rests on our ability to harness the power of AI and DeFi
for good.

2024-05-04 07:00:00,"sanctions, hobbled economy hit iran’s traditional carpet weavers hard"," An Iranian woman weaves a carpet at a workshop in the city of Kashan, Iran, about 245 kilometers south of the capital, Tehran, April 30, 2024. 
The historic Kashan bazaar in central Iran once sat on a major caravan route, its silk carpets known the world over. But for the weavers trying to sell their rugs under its ancient arches, their world has only unraveled since the collapse of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers and wider tensions with the West. 
Rug exports, which exceeded $2 billion two decades ago, have plummeted to less than $50 million in the last year in the Persian calendar that ended in March, according to government customs figures. With fewer tourists coming and difficulties rising in making international transactions, Iranian rugs are going unsold as some weavers work for as little as $4 a day. 
”Americans were some of our best customers,” said Ali Faez, the owner of one dusty carpet shop at the bazaar. ”Rugs are a luxury product and they were eager to buy it and they used to make very good purchases. Unfortunately, this has been cut — and the connection between the two countries for visitors to come and go has gone away.” 
Kashan’s rug-weaving industry has been inscribed in UNESCO’s list of the world’s ”intangible cultural heritage.” Many of the weavers are women, with the skills needed for the Farsi weaving style passed down from generation to generation, using materials like vine leaves and the skins of pomegranate fruit and walnuts to make the dyes for their threads. A single rug can take months to make. 
For decades, Western tourists and others would pass through Iran, picking up rugs as gifts and to take back home. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the U.S. increased sanctions on Iran’s theocratic government over the U.S. Embassy siege, Tehran’s links to militant attacks and other issues. 
Iranian carpet shop owner Ali Faez works at his shop at the traditional bazaar of the city of Kashan, Iran, about 245 kilometers south of the capital, Tehran, April 30, 2024. 
But in 2000, the outgoing administration of former President Bill Clinton lifted a ban on the import of Iranian caviar, rugs and pistachios. 
”Iran lives in a dangerous neighborhood,” then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at the time. ”We welcome efforts to make it less dangerous.” 
By 2010, with concerns rising over Iran’s nuclear program, the U.S. again banned Iranian-made Persian rugs. But in 2015, Iran struck a nuclear deal with world powers which greatly reduced and drastically lowered the purity of Tehran’s stockpile of enriched uranium. The rug trade was allowed once again. 
Three years later, in 2018, then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear deal. Since then, Iran began enriching uranium at near-weapons-grade levels and has been blamed for a series of attacks at sea and on land, including an unprecedented drone-and-missile attack targeting Israel last month. 
For the carpet weavers, that’s meant their wares were once again banned under U.S. law. 
”It started when Trump signed that paper,” Faez told The Associated Press, referring to the renewed sanctions. ”He ruined everything.” 
Abdullah Bahrami, the head of a national syndicate for handwoven rug producers, also blamed the collapse of the industry on the Trump sanctions. He put the value of exports to the U.S. as high as $80 million annually prior to the sanctions. 
”The whole world used to know Iran by its rugs,” Bahrami told the state-run IRNA news agency in March. 
Batches of freshly dyed thread for handwoven carpets dry in the sun at a workshop at the traditional bazaar of the city of Kashan, Iran, about 245 kilometers south of the capital, Tehran, April 30, 2024. 
Making things worse is what carpet sellers see as a drop in tourists to Kashan as well. High-value American and European tourism in Iran has largely stopped, the daily Shargh newspaper warned last year. Ezzatollah Zarghami, Iran’s minister of tourism, insisted in April that 6 million tourists visited the country over the last 12 months, though that likely includes religious pilgrims as well as Afghans and Iraqis with less spending money. 
But even those tourists that do show up face the challenge of Iran’s financial system, where no major international credit card works. 
”I had a Chinese customer the other week. He was struggling to somehow make the payment because he loved the rug and didn’t want to let go of it,” Faez said. ”We have to pay a lot of commission to those who can transfer money and have bank accounts abroad. Sometimes they cancel their orders because they don’t have enough cash with them.” 
The collapse of the rial currency has left many Iranians also unable to purchase the handwoven rugs. Wages in the industry are low, leading to a growing number of Afghan migrants working in workshops around Kashan as well. 
Designer Javad Amorzesh, one of just a few of Kashan’s old-school artists, said his orders have fallen from 10 a year to just two. He has laid off staff and now works alone in a cramped space. 
”Inflation rose every hour. People were hit repeatedly by inflation,” he said. ”I used to have four to five assistants in a big workshop.” 
Offering a bitter laugh alone in his workshop, he added, ”We’ve been left isolated.”",0.022347985

2024-05-03 09:00:00,senate finance committee introduces legislation aimed at fixing drug shortages,"Senate Finance Committee introduces legislation aimed at fixing drug shortages
by Joseph Choi - 05/03/24 5:00 AM ET
Email
The Senate Finance Committee introduced bipartisan legislation Friday aimed at preventing and reducing generic drug shortages by leveraging Medicare and Medicaid programs.
The draft legislation proposes the creation of a “Medicare Drug Shortage Prevention and Mitigation Program” that would encourage improved contracting and purchasing practices in the drug supply chain. The program would begin in 2027, according to the committee.
The provisions would include requiring Medicare participants to adopt “new standards for supply chain resiliency, reliability, and transparency” for generic drug purchasing in order to receive Medicare payment incentives.
Among these standards would be minimum three-year contracts with manufacturers, purchase volume commitments, requirements for contingency contracts with alternate manufacturers and transparency around manufacturer quality control issues.
Providers who meet core standards would be eligible for “quarterly, lump-sum incentive payments.”
Last month, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recorded the highest number of domestic drug shortages since it began tracking this metric in 2001, with 323 active shortages. Commonly prescribed drugs Adderall and Albuterol have been in shortage since 2022.
Generic drug manufacturers work with extremely thin margins, putting pressure on them to oftentimes operate at capacity. This practice, however, leaves generic drugs particularly vulnerable to shortages when disruptions occur.
Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) blamed “monopolistic middlemen” for putting “market power and profit over families’ health care.”
“Our bipartisan proposal uses the power of Medicare and Medicaid to ensure the entire American health care system has adequate supply for key medicines across the country,” Wyden said. “Middlemen like GPOs should not be able to do business with Medicare if their contracting practices are actively worsening the drug shortage challenge in America.”
“Prescription drug shortages are fueling high prices and limiting access to life-saving treatments and cures,” ranking member Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said. “We look forward to working with other members, experts and stakeholders on addressing these life-threatening challenges and promoting consistent, cost-effective health care for Americans nationwide.”",0.12373364

2024-05-04 14:11:54,14 best financial sector dividend stocks to invest in," In this article, we discuss 14 best financial sector dividend stocks to invest in. You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Invest In. 
2023 didn’t start out very rosy for the financial sector, marked by the sudden collapses of notable regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders. 
That said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn’t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk. The report further mentioned that over 280 US banks, collectively holding nearly $900 billion in assets, face potential capital needs due to high levels of exposure to commercial real estate and losses related to interest rates. 
Many financial analysts anticipate rate cuts in 2024 that could mainly influence the performance of bank stocks. Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo discussed the outlooked with Bloomberg and said: 
> “There are a number of factors that can impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior, to name just a few. All of which we have little to no control over.” 
As a result of this, some of the biggest banks such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) have been crystal ball gazing and predicting declines in their net interest income(NII) for 2024. On the other hand, we saw how high-interest rates last year were beneficial for the biggest banks as they managed to amass $253 billion in NII, marking an increase of approximately $80 billion compared to the total in 2021. S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings. 
Financial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders. In fact, if we look at the recent data, we get to know that nearly half of the global increases in dividend payouts in 2023 originated from banks, exceeding their share in the total dividend payments, which is one-sixth, according to a report by Janus Henderson. The report also mentioned that the significant 15% rise, reaching a record $220 billion, primarily came from banks’ improved profitability due to the normalization of interest rates following years of loose monetary policies. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks from the financial sector.

Our Methodology: 
For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. From the resultant list, we picked 14 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 
In addition to covering topics like the best dividend stocks to buy, at Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, artificial intelligence technology is on the cusp of earth-shattering breakthroughs, so we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times its market value excluding cash and investments with the potential to deliver 100x returns. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. You can subscribe to our free daily enewsletter on our website.

2024-05-04 15:00:22,budgeting too scary? try cash-flow planning instead to help your finances," By Patricia Domingo 
As a certified financial planner who has been helping clients for more than 20 years, I’ve found that most people cringe at the idea of budgeting. Everyone assumes that it translates into restrictions, and who wants to be restricted in their lifestyle? 
As a result, I’ve found that many clients lack a monthly budget, including those who have more than sufficient income to cover their needs. 
I understand why clients hate the budgeting exercise when it comes to financial planning. I imagine it’s like when my fitness and nutrition coach reminds me of my 10-pound weight-loss goal and the need to start tracking my food macros daily. “I’ll get right on that,” said no one ever. 
As a result, I’ve changed my approach with clients to instead focus on “cash-flow planning.” But what does that mean and why is it so important in all stages of life? 
Cash-flow planning can feel like an insurmountable task when you’re early in your career, especially during recent inflationary times. Salaries are entry level with minimal annual increases, while housing costs — renting or owning — are at or near all-time highs. Throw in inflated food prices, student debt and/or taxes, and the list of costs can seem endless. 
There can be very little left after monthly needs to cover discretionary spending, much less for a savings and investment strategy. But I like to remind clients that squeaking out even $100 per paycheque towards investments creates a healthy habit that can be built upon over time. 
Eventually, things start to feel a bit better as you progress in your career or with your business, along with an income that follows suit. It becomes a balancing act between how much you should pay towards your liabilities and how much you should contribute towards long-term investments. Which goals should take priority: an emergency fund, saving for a down payment, children’s education or retirement? 
Many clients are hyper-aware of their debt and want to quickly pay it off at the expense of building up investment assets. However, various tax-savings opportunities (first-home savings account, registered retirement savings plan or a tax-free savings account) and government grants (for a registered education savings plan and registered disability savings plan) can make savings lucrative, particularly early on when time and the effects of compounding returns are on your side. 
This is where cash-flow planning is effective. Once you know how much cash flow you have after paying the necessities, an adviser can help you determine how best to allocate that excess cash flow between both liabilities and savings. The best plan will be different for everyone and must evolve for each person’s and/or family’s changing situation, so it is imperative to have a professional regularly guide you through the options. 
I find that cash-flow planning is also extremely useful in managing risk. As clients grow their investments and approach their retirement years, they are typically still interested in growth, but capital preservation becomes equally, if not more, important. 
Every client’s nightmare is for the markets to suddenly drop when they retire. Therefore, it’s important to estimate what your investments need to generate each year in retirement, in addition to your various government and private pensions, and structure your investments accordingly in conjunction with your risk tolerance. 
The retirement transition phase is always a little worrying for clients, regardless of their net worth. You go from having one paycheque where your employer takes off enough taxes for you during your working years to having three to six different payments (Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, private pensions, investments and registered account payments), and it is your responsibility to determine how much tax to withhold. 
In later retirement years, there could be increased costs for personal care workers and/or retirement homes that will affect your finances as well. An experienced financial planner can help you plan for all these considerations and simplify what can be a long and complex transition. 
The final phase of wealth is one of legacy and transfer. Once all your goals and long-term needs are sufficiently provided for, how do you want to transfer the remaining wealth, whether to family and/or charitable giving? Will that wealth pass on during your lifetime or in your estate? Will it be over a period of years or all at once? 
Cash-flow planning will also help us estimate taxable income during your lifetime and in death, allowing us to offer advice on how to make the most of the wealth transfers on a tax-efficient basis, thereby extending the value of those gifts. 
By now, it should be clear that cash-flow planning (ahem, budgeting) is integral to helping you reach your goals and maximize your wealth at various times in your life. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to work on that dreaded food tracking I’ve been procrastinating on.
